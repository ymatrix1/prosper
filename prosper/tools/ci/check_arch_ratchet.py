"""Architecture ratchet: stop ten measured cross-title and structural costs from growing.

Why this exists
---------------
Some costs are paid by every title and keep growing because nothing stops them: title ids and
title-named modules inside shared code, blocking GPU syncs, raw `getenv` reads scattered through
hot code, a few source files that only ever get longer, and the shipping frontend depending on the
test namespace. None of them is a bug on the day it lands, so review waves each one through, and
the total only rises. This gate turns each into a per-file count that may go DOWN, never UP.

The rules (every count is per file, over tracked files only, with comments stripped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  title-id       `PPSA#####` / `CUSA#####` in code under prosper/src and prosper/frontends.
                 String literals COUNT -- a title id in a string is still title-specific code.
                 Comments do not: a comment naming the capture a fact came from is fine.
  title-dir      a directory under prosper/src whose basename is a title slug. The row's value is
                 the total line count of the C/C++ sources in that directory, which may shrink but
                 not grow. Slugs are DERIVED from the per-title route folders in prosper/scripts/
                 (`gta5`, `sonic-frontiers-PPSA03831`, ...): the folder name, minus any trailing
                 title id, in its `-`, `_` and run-together spellings; plus any `ppsa#####` /
                 `cusa#####` basename.
  getenv         `getenv(` / `std::getenv(` / `secure_getenv(` call sites in prosper/src,
                 prosper/frontends and prosper/tests/fixtures/render_runner.h.
  blocking-sync  vkWaitForFences, vkQueueWaitIdle, vkDeviceWaitIdle,
                 VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT, one row
                 per file per token, same roots as getenv.
  file-size      a C/C++ file under prosper/src, prosper/frontends or prosper/tests/fixtures longer
                 than FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD lines may not exceed its baselined line cap.
  test-dep       `prosper::test::` in code under prosper/frontends -- the shipping app depending on
                 the test namespace.
  platform-ifdef preprocessor conditionals (`#if`/`#ifdef`/`#ifndef`/`#elif`...) that test a host
                 platform macro (PLATFORM_MACROS: `_WIN32`, `_WIN64`, `__linux__`, `__APPLE__`,
                 `__MINGW32__`, `_MSC_VER`), one per directive, in prosper/src/{hle,loader,self,
                 gpu}. src/host is exempt: that is where host-platform code belongs. The seam this
                 pushes code towards is prosper/docs/HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md.
  layer-include  an `#include` from one prosper/src top-level layer into a layer it may not depend
                 on, one row per (file, target layer), valued by the number of include lines.
                 LAYER_ORDER below is the table: a layer may include itself and any layer EARLIER
                 in the list, never a later one; nothing under prosper/src may include frontends/
                 or tests/. Files directly in prosper/src (build_revision.hpp) belong to no layer
                 and may be included from anywhere. `"a/b.hpp"` resolves against prosper/src (the
                 include root); `"../x"` resolves against the including file's directory.
  fixture-include  `#include "fixtures/..."` (prosper/tests/fixtures) from code under
                 prosper/frontends -- the shipping renderer built out of the test tree
                 (render_runner.h is the live Vulkan backend today).
  vk-object      call sites of vkCreateDescriptorPool, vkAllocateMemory and vkCreateFence (one row
                 per file per token, same roots as getenv) -- a static proxy for creating Vulkan
                 objects per draw/submit instead of pooling them. A count, not a proof: most
                 sites are one-time setup, which is why it is a ratchet and not a ban.

Verdicts
--------
  new        a key not in the baseline                      -> FAIL (fix it; see the rule's hint)
  increase   a count above its baseline row                 -> FAIL
  decrease   a count below its baseline row                 -> FAIL until the row is lowered
  stale      a baseline row whose key no longer reproduces  -> FAIL until the row is deleted

The last two exist for the same reason as in tools/env/check_diag_gates.py: a baseline nobody is
forced to update stops describing the tree, and an unlowered row is headroom the next change can
quietly spend. `--update` applies exactly those two repairs -- it lowers and deletes rows and NEVER
raises or adds one -- so recording an improvement costs one command.

The two LINE-COUNT rules (title-dir, file-size) are caps rather than exact counts: any growth past
the cap fails, but a shrink only reports `decrease` once it is more than SHRINK_MARGIN below the
cap. That band is the concurrency tradeoff. With an exact count, every edit to a 16,000-line file
-- among the most frequently edited files in the tree -- would rewrite the same baseline row, so
two unrelated lanes would conflict on the baseline even though neither grew anything. With the
band, ordinary edits touch the baseline only when they actually move the cap. The price: up to
SHRINK_MARGIN of slack that a later change may re-grow into without failing. The cap itself never
rises unless a reviewer reads a baseline diff that raises it.

The count rules use exact values and per-file (per-token) rows, so two lanes conflict on the
baseline only when both change the same count in the same file -- and then they genuinely did.

Raising a row is the escape hatch, as in every ratchet: a one-line baseline edit a reviewer sees,
with a `# note` saying why. A new blocking-sync site in particular must name the guest-visible
result it delivers, in a comment beside it and in the PR.

Two modes: delta (what CI and the agent hook run) and full (baseline maintenance)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FULL mode (no `--base`) is everything above: the whole tree against every row. It is the right
tool for maintaining the baseline and the wrong one for gating a change, because the tree moves
under every row. A PR that grows a capped file merges, the row is now stale, and from then on a
full check fails for every unrelated change until somebody repairs a row they never touched. That
happened on the day this gate was written (#4173 grew two capped files while it was in review).

DELTA mode (`--base REF`) answers only "did THIS change make anything worse?". It takes the merge
base of HEAD and REF (so a branch behind REF is not blamed for what REF changed since), and looks
only at the files that differ between that merge base and the working tree -- committed, staged,
unstaged, and untracked-but-not-ignored, so an agent is told before `git add -A` rather than after.
For every key those files touch it computes the count at the merge base and in the working tree,
and FAILS only when the count rose AND the working tree's baseline row does not cover the new
value. A file that did not exist at the merge base is compared against zero. So:

  * a pre-existing over-row count in a file this change did not touch never fails delta mode;
  * a rise inside a capped file's existing headroom passes, exactly as it does in full mode;
  * the escape hatch still works: raise the row, with its note, in the same change.

A title-dir key aggregates a directory, so a change to any file inside one compares the whole
directory's total. A moved file shows up as a NEW key under its new path: rename its row in the
same change. Decreases are reported as a notice (lower the row with `--update` when you can) and
never fail delta mode -- requiring them would recreate the concurrency problem full mode has.
Base contents are read with one `git cat-file --batch`; nothing outside the changed set is read.

What this CANNOT see -- read before quoting a clean run
-------------------------------------------------------
  * It is a lexer, not a compiler. `#if 0` blocks count as live; a macro that expands to `getenv`
    counts once, at its definition, not at each use. Calls through other wrappers (`SDL_getenv`,
    `_wgetenv`, `GetEnvironmentVariable`, the cached `PROSPER_ENV_*` macros) are not counted.
  * Comment stripping understands `//` (including backslash-continued), `/* */`, string and char
    literals with escapes, raw strings (`R"d(...)d"` with any encoding prefix) and C++14 digit
    separators (`1'000`). It does not understand trigraphs or `#include <a//b>`.
  * blocking-sync, getenv and test-dep ignore string-literal contents (a log message saying
    "vkWaitForFences failed" is not a sync); title-id reads them.
  * A vkWaitForFences reached through a dispatch-table member (`d.vkWaitForFences`) counts; one
    through a differently named `PFN_vkWaitForFences` variable does not.
  * Only C-family suffixes are scanned (SOURCE_SUFFIXES). Shaders, assembly and Python are not.
  * layer-include resolves `"a/b"` against prosper/src only. A quoted include the compiler would
    find next to the including file first would be attributed to the wrong layer. Includes
    produced by macros are not seen.
  * platform-ifdef counts directives, not lines of platform code: a 200-line `#ifdef _WIN32`
    block counts 1. A platform test spelled through a project macro is not counted.
  * vk-object cannot tell a per-draw creation from a one-time one; it only stops the count rising.
  * The slug list is only as complete as prosper/scripts/. A title with no route folder is not a
    slug, so `src/.../<that-title>/` would not be caught.

Exit status: 0 clean, 1 violations found, 2 could not evaluate (no git, empty scan, unparseable
baseline, a sanity floor tripped, a `--base` that is not a commit here or shares no merge base
with HEAD). 2 is never "clean": a scan that saw nothing proves nothing.

`--base REF` runs delta mode; `--selftest` runs hand-built positive and negative arms; `--list`
prints every finding with line numbers; `--emit-baseline` prints the rows for the current tree.
