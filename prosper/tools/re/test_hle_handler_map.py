"""test_hle_handler_map — unit tests for the registration-table parser behind hle_handler_map.py.

The tool answers "how many Sony entry points collapse onto ONE prosper handler?", and every way it
can be wrong produces a plausible-looking smaller (or larger) table rather than a visible failure.
Two of the cases below are regressions for defects that had already reached a published measurement
(#2070):

  * **Both arms of one `#if` counted as two Sony names.** `hle_kernel_mem.cpp` defines
    `register_kernel_mem_hle()` twice, ~3,200 lines apart, in the two arms of one
    `#if defined(__linux__) || defined(__APPLE__)`. A line-based extraction sees every kernel-memory
    handler registered "twice" and promotes it to a shared handler — five handlers that answer
    exactly one Sony function each were counted as collapses this way.
  * **Registration counted per SITE instead of per distinct Sony name.** `scePthreadAttrSetaffinity`
    is registered twice to `k_attr_noop` (hle_kernel.cpp:4539 and :4588). It is one entry point, and
    counting the lines rather than the names inflates every handler that has a duplicate.

The rest pin the properties that make a zero from this tool readable at all: that the shape list is
DISCOVERED rather than hardcoded, that a shape it cannot parse is reported instead of dropped, and
that a registration BLOCK is never mistaken for a forwarding wrapper (which would empty the census).

Run directly, or via ctest as `re_hle_handler_map`.
