# Shader inspect

`shader_inspect` decodes one raw RDNA2 shader. It is the fast offline path for mapping shader control
flow before changing the recompiler.

```bash
cmake --build build-linux -j8 --target shader_inspect
./build-linux/shader_inspect /tmp/shaders/exec_ps_7f123400.bin

# Run the complete stage translator too; PROSPER_DBG identifies a contextual rejection PC.
PROSPER_DBG=1 ./build-linux/shader_inspect /tmp/shaders/exec_vs_7f123400.bin --stage vertex
PROSPER_DBG=1 ./build-linux/shader_inspect /tmp/shaders/exec_cs_7f123400.bin --stage compute
```

`PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP=DIR` writes raw shaders that fail recompilation. To inspect a shader that succeeds,
run the title or replay with `PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP_SUCCESS=DIR`. Each unique successful graphics or compute shader
produces a pair such as:

```text
success_ps_at_00000005008f1400_35956264829da0c6_62ad8faab4566b7a.bin
success_ps_at_00000005008f1400_35956264829da0c6_62ad8faab4566b7a.spv
success_cs_at_0000000413dc6700_6f6a5fdd6e9f8d73_2339aa565126d182.bin
success_cs_at_0000000413dc6700_6f6a5fdd6e9f8d73_2339aa565126d182.spv
```

The field after the stage tag is the **guest code address** (#3196), so a program you identified by
address is one glob away — `ls DIR/success_*_at_00000005008efd00_*` — and
`PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP_PROGRAM=0x5008efd00` narrows the run to it so a 4K boot does not write thousands
of modules. A chained vertex program also writes a `_main_<main-addr>_<main-hash>.bin` holding its NGG
continuation, and either half's address selects the pair. See `tools/AGENTS.md` for the filter's full
contract, including why a malformed spec dumps everything rather than nothing.

For a large live compute program that reaches the backend but fails during Vulkan pipeline creation,
filter the backend trace by guest code address and dump only that exact translated module:

```sh
PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_CODE=0x50057b800 \
PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_SPIRV=~/prosper-shaders/target.spv \
  ./build-linux/prosper-app --dump <DUMP_ROOT>/PPSA21564-app0
spirv-val --target-env vulkan1.2 ~/prosper-shaders/target.spv
```

The destination directory must already exist. As with raw shader dumps, the resulting SPIR-V is
title-derived diagnostic data: keep it local and do not commit it.

`PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_RAW=PATH` is the other half of that pair, and it is the one `shader_inspect`
consumes: it writes the **guest RDNA2 bytes** of the same traced program, so "what did the guest
write" and "what did we emit" can be compared for one address in a single run.

```sh
PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_CODE=0x413dc6700 \
PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_RAW=~/work/target.bin \
PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_SPIRV=~/work/target.spv \
  ./build-linux/prosper-app <DUMP_ROOT>/<TITLE_ID>-app0
./build-linux/shader_inspect ~/work/target.bin        # guest ISA, with resolved branch targets
```

Reach for it whenever the question is about **control flow** — where the loops are, what a loop's
exits are, whether a branch is backward. `PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP_SUCCESS` also writes raw `.bin` files,
and since #3196 those filenames carry the code address too, so either route recovers a program by
address; this one is still the right choice when you want *one* live traced program and its emitted
SPIR-V written to exact paths you name. The program length is re-derived by decoding to the program's
own terminator rather than trusted, and a run prints what it wrote:

```text
[compute]   traced raw program=0x413dc6700 dwords=903 instructions=781 window=262144 path=... result=written
```

The first hash identifies the translated SPIR-V and the second identifies the exact raw RDNA2 stream.
Pass the `.bin` file to `shader_inspect`; use the adjacent `.spv` for SPIR-V disassembly or validation.
The dump directory is created automatically. `vs`, `ps`, and `cs` identify vertex, pixel, and compute stages.

Each instruction row includes its dword PC, encoded length, format/opcode, exact raw words, decoded
operands, and, for SOPP branches, the signed immediate and resolved target PC. The header also prints
the stage-agnostic `recompile_coverage` result. That coverage is intentionally compute-safe; a VCC
control-flow shape may remain listed there even when the vertex/fragment structurizer accepts it.
`--stage vertex|fragment|compute` additionally runs the complete stage translator, which exposes contextual
resource and structured-control-flow failures that per-instruction coverage cannot decide.

## `--mimg-sites`: the MIMG census, for tools that must not carry their own decoder

```bash
./build-linux/shader_inspect exec_ps_7f123400.bin --mimg-sites
mimg-site pc=0042 op=0x20 dim=5
mimg-site pc=0061 op=0x00 dim=1
mimg-sites-end dwords=903 consumed=903 instructions=781 sites=2 endpgm=1
```

One line per image instruction — its dword PC, its 8-bit opcode with the split MSB already
reassembled, and its `DIM` — and nothing else: no coverage, no stage recompile, no resource-table
reasoning. The default listing is untouched; this replaces it, and combining it with `--stage` is a
usage error so the exit code stays unambiguous.

**Why it exists.** `tools/shader_conformance/scan.py` needs to know where the image instructions are
in a raw dump, and to do that it needs real instruction lengths — otherwise an operand or a trailing
literal dword whose top six bits alias the MIMG encoding reads as an instruction. It used to carry
its own Python port of `rdna2_decode_one`'s format and length dispatch for exactly that (#3040). The
port was correct, and that was never the problem: a copy of a decoding rule is the one nobody
updates when the decoder learns a new literal-forcing opcode or a wider NSA field, and it fails by
silently returning a plausible instruction stream. This flag deletes the copy (#3184).

`mimg-sites-end` is a **completion sentinel, not decoration**. A consumer must be able to tell "this
shader contains no image instruction" — the answer that certifies a clean conformance scan — from
"this process printed nothing because it died", and those two must never look alike. `scan.py`
refuses any census that arrives without it, and cross-checks its `sites=` count against the number
of `mimg-site` lines it parsed — so a line the consumer's parser stops matching is loud rather than
a quietly smaller census.

Exit is `0` whenever the file was read and walked; `2` for usage or I/O errors, including an empty
input or one that is not a whole number of dwords. A stream that stops short of `s_endpgm` is
reported as `endpgm=0` rather than as a failure — a census over a truncated dump is still an exact
census of what could be decoded.

## `--wave-reasons`: which shaders need the guest Wave64, and why

On the measured Windows/RTX4090 host, fragment subgroups are `32..32`. A source requiring Wave64
needs a correct lowering or is refused with a diagnostics alarm; host limits must be measured.

```sh
shader_inspect <raw-rdna2.bin> --wave-reasons
wave-reasons required-subgroup-size=64 reasons=0x2 names=wave-any reason-set-admissible=1 \
    internal-gds=0 subgroup-features=0x1 wave-width-independent=1
wave-reasons gate-undecided=fragment-policy,rewrite-certificate,pass-input-authority,host-subgroup-size-control,host-subgroup-features ...
wave-reasons-end file=... input=rdna2 dwords=12 recompiled=1 table_dependent=0 endpgm=1
```

### `reason-set-admissible` is NOT `admitted`, and the difference is most of the answer

This is a legacy source-classifier field, not the current renderer's rewrite certificate.
Live frontends explicitly request title-independent `ProvenVotes`; replay defaults to `Strict`.
The transformation must prove every vote safe, including helper values and execution/effect
obligations. Buffer predicates additionally need immutable pass inputs and an enabled deterministic
read contract. This tool evaluates none of those run-time authority conditions.

### `wave-width-independent` is a source property, not permission to rewrite

Whether the module answers the same over two 32-lane groups as over one 64-lane wave, decided per
module by `fragment_spirv_wave_width_independent` (`src/gpu/recompiler/rdna2_to_spirv.hpp`).
It is retained for source investigation and explicit diagnostic paths. Output independence alone
does not prove a collective can be deleted: derivatives, termination and memory ordering matter.

The reason set alone cannot answer this and neither can value reachability, which is the mistake
this field replaced: a vote used only as a branch condition never flows into a store, yet it
decides which store runs. Over 49 real fragment modules from four titles, value reachability
cleared 49 while control dependence cleared 1; the shipped predicate clears 38. Both
falsifications are in `RECOMPILER_REMAINING.md`'s *Ruled out* table.

`wave_width_independent.py` answers the same question over a directory of `.spv` dumps, and the
two implementations are cross-checked against each other on that corpus.

Module properties (`internal-gds`, `subgroup-features`) are reported separately from the
undecided run-time contracts. `capture_wave_census.py --title` attaches provenance only, not
admission authority. Actual admitted/refused counts come from live logs (`skip_survey.py`).

A module that needs no particular width reports `size=0 reasons=absent reason-set-admissible=0`.
`reasons=0x0` is never printed: a module either carries the marker or does not, and `absent` is
not none. A module that fails to recompile prints **no census row at all** -- only the sentinel,
with `recompiled=0`.

A SPIR-V input reports `recompiled=n/a` (nothing was recompiled -- the module was read) plus
`spirv-walk=ok|truncated`. That last field exists because a corrupt module reports `size=0
reasons=absent`, byte-identical to a genuine wave-free shader, so without it an unreadable dump
lands in the population that says #3464 does not affect it.

`wave_reason_census.py` tallies the mode over a directory and prints the reason-set histogram
plus the names of the dropped shaders. It exists because the *runtime* skip log answers this
only for whatever a route happened to reach, once per distinct shader, at whatever scene depth
the run stopped: two runtime counts taken that way, 43 and 86, differed by run length alone and
read as a regression until they were matched by frame.

`route_candidates.py census.csv` reads that census's `--csv` output and sorts the wide-wave shaders'
reason sets by which of ADR 0028's route-2 rewrites (uniform readlane, compaction ballot, uniform
vote) they could apply to; `scalar-reduce` (a WaveAny result reaching a scalar consumer) is covered
when a `wave-any` is present. It is an upper bound that admits nothing: a reason bit says the
operation is present, not that its operand is uniform, so each rewrite still needs its own proof.

### Measured limit: over a raw dump this mode is mostly blind, and says so

Run against a 3,453-shader dump of GTA V's pixel-shader database (2026-09-08):

```
files=3453  errors=0  unrecompiled(no resource table)=3430  analysed=23
```

**99.3% contributed no reason data.** A real pixel shader samples a texture, and the section
below explains why a table-less tool can never lower one. The 23 that were analysed are the
shaders that happen not to touch memory, which is not a random sample of anything -- a
texture-sampling lighting shader is exactly the kind that is missing.

This is reported rather than hidden: an unrecompilable shader is counted in its own column and
is **never** tallied as `requires nothing`, and the tally prints the caveat both above and below
its numbers. A census that silently equated "could not be analysed" with "needs no wide wave"
would have reported that GTA V has essentially no Wave64 problem, which is the opposite of the
truth.

### The way out: read the module gpu_replay compiled

`--wave-reasons` accepts **either** a raw RDNA2 stream **or** a SPIR-V module, detected by the
SPIR-V magic rather than by a flag or a file extension -- the magic is the format's own
self-identification, so a renamed or mislabelled file cannot be read as the wrong kind.

`gpu_replay` has the real resource table, and `--dump-shader DRAW:fs PATH` already writes the
recompiled module. So the census over memory-using shaders is a two-step pipeline with no new
analysis in it:

```sh
gpu_replay --dump-shader 18:fs fs.spv <capture>.prgcap   # real descriptors, real compile
shader_inspect fs.spv --wave-reasons                     # reads the module's own markers
```

The reasons then come from a real-table compile while this tool remains the single place that
formats them. A SPIR-V input reports `input=spirv` in the sentinel and leaves `table_dependent`
and `endpgm` at zero -- those describe an RDNA2 walk that did not happen.


## `--raw-wide-proof`: why a wide scalar load needs backing (#4422)

```
shader_inspect <raw-rdna2.bin> --raw-wide-proof [--wave64]
```

Prints one `raw-wide-load` row per `s_load_dwordx4/x8` with the three code-side proofs that
decide whether its loaded words may be used as numeric data:

- `needs-backing` — the load has a numeric reader, or it has a register SOFFSET in a program
  that may write guest memory, so it needs a current-byte backing snapshot.
- `entry-proven` — the entry-pointer and lifetime proof, evaluated on the same load with
  SOFFSET nulled, which is how the register proof evaluates it.
- `register-proven` — the register SOFFSET's reaching scalar definition is authenticated
  against the full stream.

A row with `needs-backing=1` also says **what** made the classifier call the load numeric
(#4499), as two `pc:kind` pairs appended after the nine fields above:

- `backing-blocker` — the first instruction that stopped the cheap walk asking "may the loaded
  words be replaced by a descriptor placeholder":
  - `data-read`: an ordinary scalar read of a word that walk still considers loaded;
  - `unknown-or-indirect-control`, `unmodelled-control`: the walk could not follow the program;
  - `destination-above-s105`: the load writes into VCC or above (reported at the load).
- `numeric-blocker` — the first instruction that stopped the walk asking "is there a numeric
  reader, or a path that cannot be followed":
  - `numeric-reader`: a non-scalar instruction reads a value derived from the load;
  - `derived-value-leaves-scalar-data`: a derived value reaches EXEC, a SETREG or a non-SGPR
    destination;
  - `derived-value-enters-m0`, `derived-value-enters-exec`: a derived word is moved into M0 or
    EXEC, which later instructions read without naming them (#4547, #4574);
  - `destination-above-s105`: the load itself writes VCC, M0 or EXEC (reported at the load);
  - `scc-branch-on-derived-value`, `exec-branch-on-dependent-exec`: control flow depends on it;
  - `load-re-executed`: control returned to the load and it could not be shown to read the same
    bytes again (reported at the load);
  - `register-offset-with-guest-memory-write`: no reader was found, but the load has a register
    offset in a program that may write guest memory (reported at the load);
  - `implicit-vcc-reader`: a select, carry-in or vccz/vccnz branch consumes VCC while it holds a
    derived word and is not known to be a fresh mask;
  - `unknown-instruction`, `unmodelled-control-or-relative-sgpr`, `unmodelled-control`,
    `branch-target-out-of-range`, `branch-target-mid-instruction`, `walk-budget`: the walk could
    not follow the program.

```
raw-wide-load pc=1 op=0x2 sbase=s28 soffset-kind=1 soffset=20 imm=0x0 needs-backing=1 entry-proven=0 register-proven=0 backing-blocker=7:data-read numeric-blocker=1:load-re-executed
```

Read the two pcs in the listing before changing a proof: the same `needs-backing=1` has stood
for an over-wide operand (#4429), a compare whose mask width the walk cannot know, and a
descriptor load inside a loop (#4519) — three different repairs.

**`--wave64`** answers the second of those. By default the walks assume a compare into a register
pair may write only the low word, which is what happens at 32 lanes, so the high word of a pair
the shader recycles as a mask is taken to still hold what was loaded. At 64 lanes it writes both.
With the flag, `needs-backing` and the two blockers are the answer for a program known to run 64
lanes wide, and the sentinel line ends in `wave64=1`. The dump does not record the width: for a
fragment program it is the draw's `SPI_PS_IN_CONTROL.PS_W32_EN`, and the live path applies the
64-lane answer only to the question of whether a draw needs the owned-wave path (#4555). A load
that is flagged without the flag and clear with it is one of those. `entry-proven` and
`register-proven` do not take a width.

A `raw-wide-proof-end` line terminates the output. Unlike `--stage`, these proofs read code
only, so a raw dump answers them exactly. A row with `needs-backing=1 entry-proven=0` is a
load the recompiler is expected to refuse with `[smem-reject] reason=raw-wide-data-requires-backing`
unless another admission route applies (the tool has no resource table to evaluate those).

## `--stage` cannot prove a shader is unsupported (#1571)

**`shader_inspect` has no resource table, and a table-less stage rejection is NOT evidence of a shader
defect.** A raw dump carries instructions but no descriptors, so the tool can never build a
`ShaderResourceTable`. The recompiler then refuses — by design — to lower anything that resolves a
V#/T#/S# through that table: `MIMG`, `MUBUF` and `MTBUF` in every stage, and additionally `SMEM` in the
**vertex and fragment** stages, which gate scalar memory on `allow_smem = (rt != nullptr)`. Compute
passes `allow_smem = true`, so constant-buffer loads are fine there — but compute image and buffer ops
still need the table.

The gates live in `emit_alu` in `src/gpu/recompiler/rdna2_to_spirv.cpp` (MIMG rejects on `!allow_smem || !rt`,
SMEM on `!allow_smem`); the per-stage `allow_smem` values are set by `recompile_fragment_impl` and
`recompile_vertex_impl` (`rt != nullptr`) versus `recompile_compute` (`true`). Those functions are named
rather than cited by line because line numbers drift — grep the names.

When such an instruction is present the tool now reports:

```text
stage-recompile stage=fragment status=undetermined-no-resource-table spirv_dwords=0 table_dependent=17
stage-recompile NOTE: TOOL LIMITATION, NOT A SHADER DEFECT. ...
```

Treat `undetermined-no-resource-table` as "no verdict", never as a missing opcode. This mattered: on a
corpus of 114 shaders that had provably recompiled and rendered live, the pre-fix tool called **109 of
them `rejected`** — 33/35 compute, 27/29 fragment, 49/50 vertex. Agents acted on those false leads.

**And a reject that IS reported here can still name a different PC than the live one.** The missing
table is not only a missing descriptor set: with no launch state there are no seeded scalar inputs
either, so the Wave64 MUST dataflow starts with an empty `scalar_words` and `scalar_scc = false`, and
every proof that depends on a user-data SGPR fails offline that would hold live. Worked example
(#2790): Sonic Frontiers' `0x2005a0ca00` writes the same VCC pair twice, at pc64 (`886afd6b`) and
pc76 (`886a6bfd`) — **12 dwords / 9 instructions apart** in the same program (`pc` is a dword offset:
`rdna2_walk` does `i.pc = pc; pc += i.len_dwords`). It rejects **live at pc76** and **offline at
pc64**, because offline the *first* of the two already lacks its scalar sources. The offline PC was a
real reject of a real defect, and it was still the wrong PC to reason from: the two sites carry
different words and have different causes. Use the offline run to iterate quickly once you know the shape, and
take the PC itself from the live `[compute] skip unsupported program …` line.

**You can now supply the launch shape, and for any Wave64 MUST question you should.** Three
environment variables seed the `ComputeShaderConfig` the tool otherwise leaves empty:

```bash
PROSPER_SHADER_INSPECT_USER_SGPRS=14 \
PROSPER_SHADER_INSPECT_TGID=xy \
PROSPER_SHADER_INSPECT_LOCAL=16x3x1 \
PROSPER_DBG=1 ./build/shader_inspect exec_cs_2005717e00.bin --stage compute
```

`_USER_SGPRS=N` gives the launch `N` user SGPRs (`s0..sN-1`), `_TGID` enables the workgroup-id
registers that follow them (any subset of `xyz`), and `_LOCAL=XxYxZ` sets the workgroup dimensions —
the census line `local=16x3` is where those come from. Without them every SGPR the guest reads as
launch input is absent from the initial `RegState`, so `scalar_words` starts empty and an ordinary
`s_add_i32 vcc_lo, s14, 1` has a non-scalar source. Worked example (#2790): Sonic Frontiers'
`0x2005717e00` declines offline at **pc96** with a default config and at **pc481** — the live PC, 385
dwords later, and a completely different instruction — once `_USER_SGPRS=14 _TGID=xy` is supplied.
The first is a phantom the instrument manufactured. Bracket the value if you do not know it: the
right one is the smallest that makes the offline PC agree with the live `[compute] skip …` line.

**For a table-accurate verdict, use `gpu_replay`**, which has the real descriptors from a capture:

```bash
gpu_replay <capture>.prgcap --inspect-only                     # per-draw realize/fail status
gpu_replay <capture>.prgcap --dump-failed-shader FAILURE:STAGE out.bin   # a genuinely failed stage
```

Exit codes: `0` recompiled, `1` genuine defect (truncated stream, or a rejection attributable to the
shader), `2` usage/IO error, `3` undetermined because no resource table could be supplied. `3` is
deliberately non-zero — a table-less run is never reported as a pass.
When a shader contains the fully proven bounded scalar `s_setpc_b64` jump-table idiom, the header also
prints its constant-buffer selector, adjustment/clamp, complete target list, merge PC, and owning span.

The input is bounded to 16 MiB and decoding stops at the first `s_endpgm` or unknown instruction.
Raw and SPIR-V dumps contain title-derived code, are local-only, and must not be committed.
