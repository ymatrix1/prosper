// The frame ledger behind `[perf-alarm]` (#3891): always-on, near-zero-cost accumulation of the
// costs and counters the alarm rules read.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-09-27 performance pass (#3873) found six problems by hand that prosper
// already had the numbers for -- a texture cache refusing every admission, a CPU readback of a GPU
// surface ~65 times per 5 s, a VideoOut lock blocking a guest thread 85% of the time -- but only
// behind an instrument somebody had to know to switch on. The ledger is the part that is always
// running, so the alarm engine (perf_alarms.hpp) can say so without being asked.
//
// THE COST RULE, and it is the whole design constraint. Every hook here is either
//   * a relaxed atomic add on a COUNTER (per event: a texture refusal, a dropped draw) -- or, for
//     the one per-texture-reference tally, a plain thread-local increment flushed per pass, or
//   * a pair of clock reads around a COARSE event: one readback, one blocking lock wait, one
//     present, one backend pass group. Never a clock read per draw or per texture reference.
// PROSPER_RENDER_TIMING's per-draw clock reads measured ~9% of the render thread, which is why the
// existing timing census is opt-in; this must be cheap enough to leave on. Nothing here allocates,
// takes a lock, or reads the environment after first use.
//
// Header-only on purpose: render_runner.h is compiled straight into dozens of Vulkan tests that
// link only the translation units they name, and every one of them would otherwise need a new
// source added to its CMake target. The one function-local static below is a single object across
// all translation units (an inline function's statics are shared by the ODR), never destroyed.
//
// `PROSPER_NO_PERF_ALARMS=1` turns the whole thing off: hooks skip their clock reads and the
// engine never evaluates. It exists for the overhead A/B and as the global opt-out.
