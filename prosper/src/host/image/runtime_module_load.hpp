// runtime_module_load.hpp — real runtime PRX loading for sceKernelLoadStartModule (#639).
//
// Before this, "loading" a PRX only ever resolved a path against the fixed set `boot_program`
// linked BEFORE guest entry; anything else was reported ENOENT (#146's honest answer to a
// capability prosper did not have). That is fine for a title that preloads every module it uses,
// and wrong for one whose code lives in modules chosen while it runs: R-Type Delta: HD Boosted
// (PPSA26414) ships 24 per-stage PRXs under /app0/prx/ and its eboot is only a shell, so the very
// first sceKernelLoadStartModule miss left it calling a NULL DLLLoadStart (#1591).
//
// This maps, relocates, links and starts such a module at the point the guest asks for it — the
// same passes `link_program` runs at boot, applied to one module against the already-linked
// program. What it deliberately does NOT do, and why:
//
//   * It never rebinds an ALREADY-RELOCATED module's imports. prosper binds eagerly at link time,
//     so a module loaded later cannot retroactively satisfy an earlier module's import; that
//     import already points at its stub slot. Sony's loader has the same property for a module
//     that is already started.
//   * It does not model unload. sceKernelStopUnloadModule is out of scope here; a repeat load of
//     the same path returns the cached handle rather than re-running module_start.
//   * A module needing INITIAL-EXEC TLS (R_X86_64_TPOFF64) cannot be given static TLS space after
//     threads exist. Those relocations are left unapplied by apply_relocations and reported here,
//     loudly, rather than silently baked to a wrong offset. General-dynamic TLS works.
//   * Module identity is the BASENAME, because that is what the PS5's own namespace uses and what
//     sceKernelLoadStartModule's caller checks first (module_handle_for_path, #147). Two modules
//     with the same basename in different directories therefore alias to one handle, and a runtime
//     path whose basename matches a pre-linked module resolves to that module instead of loading.
//     Pre-existing semantics; #639 only makes them reachable for guest-composed paths.
