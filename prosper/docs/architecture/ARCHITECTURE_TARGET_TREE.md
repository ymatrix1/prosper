# Target source tree and layer order

> **Status: proposal.** The current-tree measurements and the layer order, which the ratchet
> enforces, are descriptive. The *target* tree is a direction the project owner has not yet approved:
> the new `src/guest/` layer, the move of the shipping Vulkan backend to `frontends/shared/backend/`,
> and the "Planned moves" table. Read them as a plan to discuss, and don't start a move from this
> document alone.

What the source tree looks like now, what it should look like, which way dependencies may point,
and the planned moves that get from one to the other. Every move is a move-only PR made with the
refactor tools; every structural cost this document names is frozen by a ratchet rule so it cannot
grow while the moves are pending.

Companion documents: `docs/architecture/HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md` (the OS-service seam in detail),
`docs/architecture/REFACTOR_PLAN_2026_09.md` (file and function splits; this document does not repeat its
measurements), `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` (what each component does). The checker is
`tools/ci/check_arch_ratchet.py`; its baseline is `tools/ci/arch_ratchet_baseline.txt`.

Measurements below were taken on main 6499c4d7 plus the ratchet branch, with the checker itself
unless stated otherwise. Re-measure rather than quoting them later.

```

## Target tree (annotated)

```
prosper/
  src/
    self/          unchanged
    loader/        unchanged, except ImportSlot comes from a lower layer (not hle/dispatch)
    input/         unchanged
    diagnostics/   observer-only; nothing from gpu/ or frontends/ (move the shared helpers down)
    host/          ONLY the OS seam (HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md)
      platform/    vm, futex, thread, fiber, fault-install, clock, file -- one interface each,
                   one backend file per OS
    guest/         NEW: guest semantics running on the host, split out of src/host/
      abi/         from host/abi
      tls/         from host/tls
      fault/       from host/fault
      memory/      from host/memory (guest memory query/copy/watch)
      image/       from host/image (mapping and running guest images, boot_program)
    gpu/           decode + recompiler only; reaches guest memory and wakeups through guest/ or
                   an interface it owns, never through hle/. No title-named folders.
    hle/           the Sony libraries; reaches gpu/ through a narrow AGC submission interface
                   instead of 23 scattered includes; no host-platform #if.
  frontends/
    shared/
      backend/     NEW: the Vulkan backend (render_runner.h and its retained_depth_* companions),
                   moved out of tests/fixtures/, namespace prosper::gpu::backend
      live/ ...    as today, including backend/ instead of fixtures/
    prosper-app/   unchanged
  tests/
    fixtures/      test-only harnesses and data again
```

Why `frontends/shared/backend/` and not `src/`: `render_runner.h` includes `frontends/shared/`
twelve times, so a move into `src/` would create twelve `src` -> `frontends` edges. Moving it next
to its consumers is behaviour-free; promoting it into `src/` later needs those dependencies cut
first. `REFACTOR_PLAN_2026_09.md` Phase 2 leaves the same choice open. `CONFIDENCE: MED`.

## Layer order (allowed dependency direction)

Enforced by the `layer-include` rule. `LAYER_ORDER` in `check_arch_ratchet.py` is the single
source; this table must change in the same PR as that constant. Lowest first; a layer may include
itself and anything **above it in this table**, never anything below.

| rank | layer | why it sits here (verified against the includes) |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `self` | parses images; includes no other layer |
| 1 | `loader` | includes `self`; "host-agnostic" per `src/loader/AGENTS.md` |
| 2 | `input` | pad state; includes no other layer |
| 3 | `diagnostics` | observer-only; included by `gpu` (35 lines), `hle` (19), `host` (3) |
| 4 | `host` | OS services and host execution; included by `hle` (63 lines) and `gpu` (16) |
| 5 | `gpu` | decode/translate; driven by `hle`'s graphics calls (`hle` includes it 23 times) |
| 6 | `hle` | the top of the core |
| -- | `frontends/`, `tests/` | **never** includable from `prosper/src` (`docs/subsystems/FRONTEND_APP.md`: "the core never depends on the frontend") |

Baselined inversions today (22 rows, 29 include lines): `host` -> `hle` (6 files: `host/image/*`,
`host/tls/guest_tls.cpp`), `loader` -> `hle` (`linker.hpp`, `tls_layout.hpp`), `gpu` -> `hle`
(10 files), `diagnostics` -> `gpu` (3 files), `diagnostics` -> `frontends`
(`readback_reason_census.cpp`).

**Target order**, once `src/guest/` exists: `self` < `loader` < `input` < `diagnostics` < `host`
(the seam) < `guest` < `gpu` < `hle`. `guest` may include `hle/dispatch` only if the dispatch
types it needs have not yet moved down; the cleaner end state moves `ImportSlot` and the dispatch
registry's data types into `guest/` or `loader/`. The frontends sit on top and may include
everything; nothing in `src/` includes them.

How this relates to the "pipeline" reading (`self/loader -> guest -> hle -> host/platform, gpu ->
backend`): that describes the *flow of a guest call*, from loading to OS service and GPU
submission. Includes run the other way — the caller includes the callee's header — so `hle` is at
the top of the include order precisely because it calls everything else.

## Planned moves

Each row is one move-only PR (or one commit, if small), made with the tool named, containing
`git mv` plus include rewrites and nothing else. Behaviour changes that the move enables come in
separate PRs afterwards.

| order | move | tool | ratchet rule that freezes the debt meanwhile |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `tests/fixtures/render_runner.h` + `retained_depth_{array,cube}_gpu.h` -> `frontends/shared/backend/` | `tools/refactor/move_module.py` | `fixture-include`, `file-size` |
| 2 | namespace `prosper::test` -> `prosper::gpu::backend` for the moved files (mechanical rename, own commit) | sed-free rename via the compiler; verify with `nm` A/B | `test-dep` |
| 3 | split the backend into translation units (`REFACTOR_PLAN_2026_09.md` Phase 2 step 3) | `tools/refactor/map_symbols.py`, `split_file.py` | `file-size` |
| 4 | `src/host/{abi,tls,fault,memory,image}` -> `src/guest/` | `move_module.py` with a new `guest_layout.txt` beside `host_layout.txt` | `layer-include` |
| 5 | add `guest` to `LAYER_ORDER` between `host` and `gpu`; re-key the moved `layer-include` rows | hand edit, reviewed | `layer-include` |
| 6 | move `ImportSlot` (and the TLS layout type) below `hle` so `loader` and `guest` stop including `hle/dispatch` | `promote_internal.py` / `move_module.py` | `layer-include` |
| 7 | host-platform calls in `src/hle` behind `src/host/platform/` interfaces, file by file (`HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md` § Migration order) | hand moves, each its own commit | `platform-ifdef` |
| 8 | `gpu` -> `hle` edges: guest memory topology and futex wakeups reached through `guest/` or a gpu-owned interface | `move_module.py` for the types, hand edits for the inversion | `layer-include` |
| 9 | `hle` -> `gpu`: a narrow AGC submission interface | hand design, then moves | `layer-include` (future: an `hle`/`gpu` row once the interface exists) |
| 10 | `src/gpu/recompiler/gta5/` contracts generalized into properties of the shader/data | hand work | `title-dir` (cap 1,832 lines) |
| 11 | `diagnostics` -> `gpu`/`frontends` helpers moved down into `diagnostics/` | `move_module.py` | `layer-include` |

## Bad practices and who owns each

Every structural cost identified in the ratchet work is either a rule in
`check_arch_ratchet.py` or listed here as not mechanically checkable yet, with the reason.

| practice | rule / owner | baseline today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title ids in conditions | `title-id` | 143 in 9 files |
| title-named directories | `title-dir` | 1 (`src/gpu/recompiler/gta5`, 1,832 lines) |
| scattered `getenv` | `getenv` | 1,111 in 108 files |
| blocking GPU syncs (fence/queue/device wait, `ALL_COMMANDS` barriers) | `blocking-sync` | 54 in 20 rows |
| oversized files | `file-size` (> 5,000 lines) | 9 files |
| shipping code depending on `prosper::test::` | `test-dep` | 343 in 25 files |
| the shipping backend under `tests/` | `fixture-include` (frontends including `fixtures/`) | 13 in 7 files |
| host-platform `#if` outside `src/host` | `platform-ifdef` | 355 in 44 files |
| reverse layer includes | `layer-include` | 29 in 22 rows |
| Vulkan object creation on hot paths | `vk-object` (call-site count of `vkCreateDescriptorPool`, `vkAllocateMemory`, `vkCreateFence`) -- a static proxy only: it cannot tell per-draw from one-time | 22 in 15 rows |
| a platform arm that is a stub or reduced copy of the other arm's logic | **not checkable yet**: a `platform-ifdef` count cannot see it, because the divergent code sits in a few large arms rather than in many directives. Owned by the `src/hle/memory/hle_kernel_mem.cpp` migration in `HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md` (move 7 in the table above). | 1 measured case: the Windows arm of `hle_kernel_mem.cpp` stubs `sceAmprAprCommandBufferConstructor` and `sceAmprCommandBufferSetBuffer`, and leaves the AMM handlers unregistered (#2384) |
| giant functions | **not checkable here**: needs a parser to find function extents. Owned by the separate clang-tidy PR as `readability-function-size`. | -- |
| per-draw object creation proven at run time | **not checkable statically**; the steady-state performance invariants in #4193 own it | -- |

## Open questions

Not settled by this document, and each needs the project owner before it becomes a move.

- **Where does a cross-cutting HLE area live?** The target tree places layers, not functional areas.
  APR (`sceAmpr*`, and the file reads and event-queue completions behind it) spans `hle/memory`,
  `hle/fs` and `hle/kernel` today. Before any of it is extracted, decide which layer it belongs to
  and which interface it uses to reach `gpu/`, since `hle` is the top of the include order.
  **Recommendation, for the owner to accept or reject:** keep `hle/` as the API surface only (NID
  handlers, argument decoding, return codes) and put the engine behind it in `guest/`: the command
  buffer model, the executor and the completion dialects, written once and platform-neutral, reaching
  the OS only through `src/host/platform/` interfaces (`vm`, `file`, `clock`). It implements guest-visible
  coprocessor semantics rather than a Sony API, which is what the proposed `guest/` layer is for, and it
  is the usual split in compatibility layers (Wine's per-platform backend behind a portable service,
  HLE service handlers over a shared emulated-hardware core in console emulators). The handlers then
  have no platform arm to fall behind. `CONFIDENCE: MED`: this follows the document's own layering and
  the seam's one-interface-per-service rule, but no APR code has been moved to test it.
- **What keeps two platform arms in step?** `HOST_PLATFORM_SEAM.md` asks for a test per interface
  that runs on both hosts, but nothing detects a platform arm that was never ported. One possible
  guard is a differential test that feeds the same recorded command-buffer stream to both hosts and
  compares what the guest can observe. `CONFIDENCE: LOW` that this is practical, and it has not been
  tried.

## Tracking

The umbrella issue for this backlog is listed in the PR that adds this document and is linked from
`tools/ci/AGENTS.md`'s ratchet entry; each planned move has its own issue there.

## Ruled out

- **Moving the Vulkan backend straight into `src/`.** It includes `frontends/shared/` twelve
  times, so the move would add twelve `src` -> `frontends` edges that `layer-include` forbids.
  Measured with `grep '#include "shared/' tests/fixtures/render_runner.h`.
