# ADR 0028: Run guest Wave64 programs on 32-lane hosts by proof, exact emulation or visible refusal

## Context

PS5 shaders are compiled for 64-lane waves. A host whose subgroups are narrower than 64 lanes
(every NVIDIA GPU at 32; AMD under drivers that do not expose a 64-lane fragment subgroup; Intel at
8/16/32; lavapipe at 8) cannot run a program whose result depends on that width. What prosper does
today, read from the code on `origin/main`:

- **Fragment.** `lower_fragment_votes` (`src/gpu/recompiler/spirv_fragment_vote_lowering.hpp`) runs
  under `FragmentWavePolicy::ProvenVotes` and admits a program only when every vote carries a
  certificate: a predicate uniform across the logical guest wave, a pure dead user graph, or a
  neutral one-arm selection. Anything else is refused, the draw is dropped, and
  `src/diagnostics/perf/wave64_refusal.hpp` prints one `[wave64-unsupported]
  refusal=fragment/subgroup-contract` line per program (with `lowering=unproved-vote` and the
  failing vote's source word), plus a start-up `[render] WARNING` stating that draws are dropped.
- **Compute.** `frontends/shared/live/live_compute.cpp` (the `subgroup-contract-absent` and
  `subgroup-too-narrow` declines) skips any dispatch whose required subgroup size, or whose lane
  operations, the host cannot satisfy, counted as `compute/subgroup-contract`. There is no
  emulation of a 64-lane wave on a narrower compute subgroup.
- **Owned logical-Wave64 graphics draws** already exist: `src/gpu/execute/owned_graphics_wave_draw.cpp`
  (#4270, #4421, #4555) runs owned per-wave graphics draws. The fragment route below (#4384) builds
  on that path rather than beside it.
- **Recompile failures** for either stage are reported separately as `fragment/recompile` and
  `compute/recompile`; those are prosper defects, not host limits, and are out of scope here.
- **One known approximation on the default path.** The Wave64 scalar-pair projection (a 64-bit
  scalar mask pair projected onto an invocation's own bit) is guarded against fabricated-zero halves
  for fragment (#4711), but the compute projection does not consult that mark (#4714, open), so
  `main` can use a synthetic zero as a lane mask today. That is a current exception to this ADR's
  "the default never approximates"; #4714 closes it.

This already satisfies `FAIL-1` for refusals: nothing refused is skipped silently. What it does not
do is run the programs. Evidence from *Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced* `PPSA28183` on
Windows with an RTX 4070 SUPER, as recorded: `docs/games/AC_BLACK_FLAG_STATUS.md` records thirteen
fragment programs refused by the recompiler and two by the backend (`subgroup-contract`,
`unproved-vote`), eighteen refused compute programs, and one start-up fragment draw (`0x407edfaf00`)
refused by the `unproved-vote` contract; the 2026-10-07 comment on #4131 (`main` `f2e5124a6`,
Windows) records three fragment `subgroup-contract` refusals. The shape of the `unproved-vote` vote
-- a `v_cmp` whose only consumer is EXEC feeding an `s_cbranch_execz` skip -- was read while
drafting this ADR and is not yet in the status doc; it is recorded there with migration step 1.
**Expectation, not measurement:** on RADV with 64-lane subgroups the `subgroup-contract` programs
should run natively. No Black Flag RADV run is recorded, and the `fragment/recompile` refusals would
fail there too.

The owner's draft PR #4384 (currently titled "gpu: checkpoint general logical64 fragment helper
launch") opens the exact fragment route on top of the owned-wave path: collect the fragment quads,
run the original pixel shader as an owned logical-64 wave in a compute-style pass, and replay its
outputs. It currently admits only straight-line, quad-local programs, and its review is open. This
ADR does not compete with it; it names it as the fragment route and sets the policy that ties all
routes together.

Reference designs, read for verification only (no code taken; paths relative to each project).
Citations are pinned to the commits read (all 2026-10-07): AnyPS5 `400ba7f5ec01`, shadPS4
`afde63182a38`, sharpemu `b02c06181a29`. Older checkouts differ; shadPS4 before that range may lack
`lower_wave64_pass.cpp`.

- **AnyPS5** emits each instruction once per half-lane context when `state.laneCount == 2`, sharing
  values proven uniform (`core/shader/recompiler/SpirvBackend/src/SpirvFlowEmitter.cpp:734-735`,
  `SpirvModuleEmitter.cpp:46`). That makes one host invocation carry two guest lanes, exact in
  divergent control flow.
- **shadPS4** lowers Wave64 ballot-style operations through workgroup shared memory, for compute
  only and only in blocks proven uniform; it warns otherwise
  (`src/shader_recompiler/ir/passes/lower_wave64_pass.cpp:106`, `:117-124`, `:151-169`). Fragment
  receives no such lowering.
- **sharpemu** plans a half-mask exchange with shared-memory barriers
  (`src/SharpEmu.ShaderCompiler/Ir/Gen5Wave64HalfMaskAnalysis.cs`, `Gen5Wave64HalfMaskPlan`).
- **vkd3d-proton** (from its documented behaviour, not re-read here) fails pipeline creation when a
  required wave size of 64 is unsupported, with no emulation.

No single implementation covers all the cases below: AnyPS5 does two-lanes-per-invocation,
shadPS4 and sharpemu do workgroup exchange for compute only, and prosper does proof plus refusal.

## Decision

One policy for every guest Wave64 program on a host that cannot offer a native 64-lane subgroup
for that stage. Let W be the host subgroup width for the stage (W < 64; 32 on NVIDIA, as low as 8
on Intel and lavapipe). Each program takes the first route that applies, chosen per shader by
analysis, and every route is logged by name. The default never approximates (the #4714 exception
above is a defect to close, not a precedent).

1. **Native.** A host that offers a required 64-lane subgroup for the stage runs the program
   natively, always. Nothing below applies to it; AMD/RADV hosts see no change.
2. **Proven width-independent: one lane per invocation, zero cost.** Programs with no cross-lane
   operation, or whose cross-lane operations are proven independent of wave width, run as plain
   one-lane-per-invocation code. The existing `ProvenVotes` certificates are this route; they are
   extended with cheap exact cases. The first candidate is *an any-vote whose only consumer is EXEC
   guarding an `s_cbranch_execz` skip* (the Black Flag case). **Masking alone does not make that
   vote neutral.** VALU work in the skipped region is EXEC-masked, but SALU and SMEM instructions
   in it execute whenever any lane of the 64-lane guest wave is active and do not execute when the
   whole wave skips. Forcing the vote TRUE runs that scalar work where hardware skipped it;
   evaluating it per W-lane host subgroup lets one subgroup skip scalar writes that another, and the
   hardware, performed. So the certificate is the existing one-arm condition
   (`spirv_fragment_vote_lowering.hpp`: TRUE control only "after proving every extra operation
   UB-free and every live merge export stable and unchanged under P=false"), made concrete for
   this shape. The region, entered with an empty EXEC, must have:
   - **no scalar live-out**: no SGPR, SCC, VCC, M0, or EXEC-derived scalar value written in the
     region and read after the merge;
   - **no scalar memory effect**: no `s_store`/`s_buffer_store`/`s_atomic`, and no scalar load whose
     address or result is meaningful only when lanes are active and is read after the merge;
   - **no wave-level side effect**: no `s_sendmsg`, `s_barrier`, `s_setreg`, `s_sleep`/trap or other
     operation that is observable or UB under the forced arm;
   - **no scalar-dependent exit**: no branch out of the region other than to the merge.
   The conditions are checked on the guest program (the 64-lane wave is the semantic target), not
   on the host lowering.

   **This route is where most of the performance is, so it is grown before any emulation.**
   Compiled code uses cross-lane operations mostly as optimisations, not as 64-lane semantics.
   With uniformity analysis (natural on `GPU-3`'s SSA IR), these become exact one-lane code:
   - a `readfirstlane`/`readlane` of a value proven wave-uniform is a move;
   - a ballot whose result only feeds a popcount for a count, or `mbcnt` used only to hand out
     unique slots whose consumer is proven order-insensitive (an append buffer, a counter
     atomic), is a workgroup-scope prefix or reduction;
   - a vote over a wave-uniform predicate is that predicate.

   Each rewrite needs the same proof standard as a certificate: a positive arm and a mutation arm.
   A rewrite that projects a 64-bit scalar mask pair onto the invocation's own bit must also prove
   neither half is a fabricated zero (the #4711 mark, consulted in both stages once #4714 lands).
   A program it fully rewrites never reaches routes 3-5.
3. **Compute, cross-lane operations only in uniform control flow: workgroup exchange.** One lane
   per invocation; ballot, vote, readlane, `mbcnt` and DPP/permutes that cross a W-lane boundary
   are lowered to an exchange across the 64 / W host subgroups of one workgroup, through workgroup
   memory with barriers (the shadPS4/sharpemu shape). Near-native parallelism; cost is shared
   memory and barriers at each exchange.
4. **Compute, cross-lane operations inside divergent control flow: N lanes per invocation.** Each
   host invocation executes N = 64 / W guest lanes (two on a 32-lane host, four on 16, eight on 8;
   the AnyPS5 shape generalised), exact under divergence. It divides the thread count by N and
   multiplies per-thread registers by about N, so occupancy and latency hiding drop; it is used
   only for programs that need it. A configuration whose register cost cannot be met (likely at
   N = 8) falls to route 6.
5. **Fragment, not proven.** Fragment invocations cannot be re-grouped by prosper and have no
   workgroup memory, so routes 3 and 4 do not apply to the fragment stage directly. Two ways in:
   - **Full-screen passes promoted to compute.** A draw proven to cover its target exactly once
     per pixel can run as a compute dispatch, which then takes route 3 or 4. That needs a single
     full-target triangle or rect with no blending, no depth/stencil test or write, no discard
     feeding a later pass and no MSAA. It writes the same texels, and post-processing chains,
     common in UE4 and Anvil titles, are mostly this shape.
   - **Everything else: the owned-wave route of #4384**, as it grows to admit more program shapes.
6. **Everything else is refused visibly**, exactly as today: draw dropped or dispatch skipped, one
   `[wave64-unsupported]` line naming the stage, program and refusal class, and the counters in
   `perf_alarms`.

An **approximate narrow-subgroup vote** (evaluating a guest vote over the host subgroup) may exist
only as an explicit, logged, default-OFF *guest-behaviour selector* under `CFG-1`, with an issue
whose resolution settles its default and deletes the switch. A run with it set is not evidence
(`VER-4`).

Performance claims are qualitative until measured. **No route becomes the default for a class of
shaders until a same-binary A/B on real titles** (`.claude/skills/perf-change/`) shows its cost,
the control arm being the route switched off (i.e. today's refusal or the cheaper route).

Adds spec rule `GPU-5` (`GPU-4` is proposed by ADR 0027, #4716).

## Consequences

- **Cost by route.** Native and proven: none. Workgroup exchange: shared memory plus one barrier
  per exchange, and a workgroup size constraint (the 64 guest lanes must sit in one workgroup).
  N lanes per invocation: 1/N of the host threads, about N times the registers per thread, possibly
  spills; correct but slowest. #4384's owned wave: an extra quad collection and replay pass per
  admitted draw.
- **Tests.** Every proof extension gets a positive and a mutation arm (a vote that does reach a
  live output must still be refused). The `s_cbranch_execz` certificate's mutation arms include,
  by name, a skipped region with an **SGPR live-out read after the merge** and one with a **scalar
  memory store**; both must be refused, and the positive arm is a hand-built region with VALU work
  only. Each compute route gets execution tests whose expected values are produced by the same
  program run at native 64-lane width on RADV, compared bit for bit. Lavapipe in CI (W = 8) and a
  32-lane host (W = 32) are different configurations of the emulated route (N = 8 and N = 2), so a
  green CI run does not cover the 32-lane case. A hand-built divergent ballot is the positive
  control for route 4, built outside the analysis that selects it.
- **Diagnostics.** The `[wave64-unsupported]` line gains a `route=` field for admitted programs, so
  a run shows which route each Wave64 program took and what is still refused.
- **AMD hosts:** nothing changes; route 1 short-circuits before any analysis.
- **Enforcement:** the refusal counters (`runtime:dropped-draws`, `runtime:skipped-dispatches`)
  and review; no tool can check that an approximation is not on by default except review against
  the switch registry.

## Alternatives considered

- **Approximate narrow-subgroup votes by default.** Makes more frames draw, but silently wrong
  whenever the subgroups disagree, which violates `FAIL-1` and turns a visible drop into an
  invisible defect.
- **Refuse forever.** Today's state; correct but leaves every NVIDIA user without the refused draws
  and dispatches, and the refusals are in shipped titles' main passes.
- **Require AMD hardware.** Abandons every user on a narrower host.
- **N lanes per invocation for every compute program.** Exact and simple, but pays the occupancy
  cost on programs that need nothing; the per-shader choice confines it.
- **Workgroup exchange for every compute program.** Cannot express divergent cross-lane operations
  exactly, which is why shadPS4 restricts it to uniform blocks.

## Migration order

1. The `s_cbranch_execz` certificate under the scalar-effect conditions in route 2, with the
   SGPR-live-out and scalar-store mutation arms (Black Flag's `unproved-vote` draw), and the vote's
   shape recorded in `AC_BLACK_FLAG_STATUS.md`. See *Approval* for when it may land.
2. Add the `route=` field and per-route counters, then census which refused programs the route-2
   rewrites (uniform `readlane`, compaction ballots, uniform votes) would admit.
3. Compute workgroup exchange for uniform control flow, with RADV-native comparison tests.
4. N-lanes-per-invocation for the divergent remainder.
5. Full-screen fragment-to-compute promotion, gated on its coverage proof and compared texel for
   texel against the fragment path where the latter runs (AMD).
6. Grow #4384's admitted shapes, on the owner's schedule.
7. Only after A/B data: decide per-class defaults; settle or delete any approximation selector.

## Open questions

- Whether routes 3 and 4 share one IR lowering with a per-program parameter, or are two passes;
  `GPU-3` (SSA IR) may make the former natural.
- How #4384's owned wave and `owned_graphics_wave_draw.cpp` relate to route 4: the logical-64 wave
  in a compute-style pass may be the same N-lane machinery, in which case fragment and compute
  converge on one implementation.
- Whether workgroup exchange is admissible when the guest's own LDS use leaves too little shared
  memory, or must fall to route 4.

## Approval

Requires the project owner's acceptance, and the owner's agreement that #4384 is the fragment
route this policy names. Acceptance unblocks migration steps 1-5. Step 1 may land before
acceptance only as its own PR that the owner reviews on its own terms, as a proof extension under
today's `ProvenVotes` policy; it does not land on the strength of this proposal.
