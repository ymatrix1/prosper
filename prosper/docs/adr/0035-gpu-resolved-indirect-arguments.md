# ADR 0035: Resolve indirect draws, dispatches and predicates on the GPU, without CPU readback

## Context

A PS5 title produces indirect arguments on the GPU: a compute pass writes a workgroup-count
triplet or a draw record, and a later packet in the same stream consumes it. prosper resolves most
of those arguments on the CPU today, which is either a wait for the producer (a `PERF-P1`
violation: an in-frame readback the guest does not observe) or a dropped operation.

What is true on `main` (d4d43d8ed) today:

- **Indirect compute dispatches have a device route (#3656).**
  `frontends/shared/live/indirect_dispatch.hpp` describes it: pin a retained GPU buffer that is
  authoritative for the 12 argument bytes, copy the triplet into a scratch record, run a
  one-invocation validation pass that zeroes a launch exceeding the device's per-axis limit, then
  `vkCmdDispatchIndirect`. When no authoritative buffer can be pinned, or the argument range aliases
  a resource of the dispatch itself, the backend counts a `host_fallbacks` and reads the triplet
  from guest memory (`live_compute.cpp:6948-6979`); an unreadable or misaligned address declines
  with `indirect-arguments-unreadable` (`live_compute.cpp:6970`).
- **Before the backend sees it, the executor refuses an indirect dispatch whose producer has not
  landed.** `gpu_executor.cpp:11741-11757` skips the dispatch, records
  `RealizationFailureReason::IndirectDependencies` and raises the always-on perf alarm
  `skipped-dispatches ... reasons=indirect-dependencies:N` (`perf_ledger.hpp:350`). The skip is
  fail-visible, which is correct, but the content it drops is real.
- **Indirect draws are resolved entirely on the CPU.** `resolve_indirect_draw_arguments`
  (`gpu_executor.cpp:10359-10444`) `memcpy`s the four-dword (`sceAgcDcbDrawIndirect`, #2929) or
  five-dword (`DRAW_INDEX_INDIRECT`) record from guest memory and turns it into a direct draw. It
  refuses `firstInstance != 0`, counts above `1 << 20`, and unreadable addresses, each with a
  rate-limited `[agc] ... indirect draw skipped` line. Reading guest memory is correct only when
  the producer is CPU-visible at that moment; a GPU-produced record is read stale or forces a wait.
  `IT_DRAW_INDEX_INDIRECT_MULTI` (`pm4_registers.hpp:37`) has no count-buffer route.
- **Predication is decided on the CPU at parse time.** `cond_indirect_buffer.cpp` reads the
  predicate from guest memory to choose a conditional branch, and refuses reserved modes (#4540);
  `SET_PREDICATION` polarity is packed by `pack_set_predication_control`
  (`cond_indirect_buffer.hpp:41`). A predicate written by a GPU occlusion query or compute pass is
  therefore the CPU's view of it, not the GPU's.

Observed evidence. In live Windows runs of *Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced* on 2026-10-07,
the `[perf-alarm]` lines reported `skipped-dispatches ... reasons=indirect-dependencies:N`. Those
counts were seen in that session and not recorded with a run manifest; the first migration step
below re-measures them (ADR 0023).

The guest argument layouts are already close to Vulkan's: the five-dword indexed record is
`VkDrawIndexedIndirectCommand` field-for-field and the four-dword record is `VkDrawIndirectCommand`.
What differs is semantics around them -- prosper's per-draw vertex-offset override, its
`index_base`, its refusal of `firstInstance`, and its guest-address-to-buffer mapping -- not the
byte layout.

Reference designs, structural only (CLAUDE.md evidence hierarchy, item 4):

- shadPS4 (`afde63182a38`) records `drawIndexedIndirectCount` / `drawIndirectCount` and
  `dispatchIndirect` straight from the guest's buffer
  (`src/video_core/renderer_vulkan/vk_rasterizer.cpp:237-381`), with no CPU read of the arguments.
- KytyPS5 (`038d2257de85`) references indirect only in its recompiler; no backend route was found.
- vkd3d-proton implements D3D12 `ExecuteIndirect` on `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` (and
  earlier on the NV extension), from knowledge; not re-read for this ADR.

## Decision

**An indirect argument the guest produces on the GPU stays on the GPU.** The CPU reads it only
when the guest itself observes that value through a CPU-visible path, and a case no route below
covers is refused fail-visibly, never guessed.

1. **Core indirect commands first.** Indirect dispatches keep the #3656 route, on both rings: the
   graphics ring's argument is an offset from the base `sceAgcDcbSetBaseIndirectArgs` sets, and the
   async-compute ring's `sceAgcAcbDispatchIndirect` passes the whole 64-bit address because that ring
   has no indirect base (`hle_agc.cpp:3564-3567`); the device route takes the resolved address
   either way. Indirect draws gain
   the same shape -- pin the authoritative buffer for the record, validate on the device, and
   record `vkCmdDrawIndirect` / `vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect`. `DRAW_INDEX_INDIRECT_MULTI` with a
   count maps to `vkCmdDraw*IndirectCount` (Vulkan 1.2 core).
2. **Argument translation is a compute pre-pass, not a CPU read.** Where a guest record differs
   from the host one (prosper's vertex-offset override, `firstInstance` handling, clamping to device
   limits, a stride the host cannot express), a small compute pass rewrites the guest record into a
   host record in device memory, as #3656's validation pass already does for dispatches. The
   pre-pass also enforces every limit the CPU path enforces today, zeroing an out-of-range launch
   and counting it.
3. **Indirect dependencies are ordering, not refusal.** A producer that has not landed for this
   submit becomes a recorded `SHADER_WRITE` -> `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` dependency on the
   producer's buffer. This is not a second barrier mechanism: it is one more access kind
   (`INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` on the argument range) fed to ADR 0011's barrier inference from the
   recorded accesses. That inference pass does not exist yet (ADR 0011 is proposed), and this item
   does not wait for it: until it lands, migration step 2 records the same dependency explicitly, of
   the same shape (`SHADER_WRITE` -> `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ` on the argument range), and 0011's
   inference pass later absorbs that explicit edge rather than adding a second one. Under ADR 0009 Stage 1, producers will routinely still be in flight when the
   consumer is recorded, so "has landed" stops being a CPU-side question at all; the inferred
   dependency is what orders them. `indirect-dependencies` remains a skip reason only where the
   producer is genuinely outside anything prosper has recorded.
4. **Predication becomes `VK_EXT_conditional_rendering`** where the guest predicate is a
   GPU-written 32-bit value over a span of draws and dispatches. Conditional *branches* over
   command streams (`COND_INDIRECT_BUFFER`) stay CPU-decided until a measured title needs more;
   where the predicate is GPU-produced and the branch matters, it is refused visibly with a named
   reason. The conditional-rendering predicate is 32-bit, so it fits only the predicate shapes this
   item scopes to; 64-bit occlusion-counter predication needs a small reduce pass that writes the
   32-bit predicate first.
5. **`VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` only for what its tokens can express**: a GPU-produced
   multi-draw or multi-dispatch sequence whose per-sequence changes fit DGC's fixed token layout
   (an execution-set pipeline or shader switch, push constants, index and vertex buffers, a sequence
   index, and a draw, dispatch or count token). It is an optional host capability, never a
   requirement; without it, such a sequence is refused with a named reason. **A GPU-written PM4 or
   AGC command stream is refused visibly**, not routed to DGC: DGC cannot express register writes
   for blend, depth or render targets, render-pass changes, events, label writes or DMA, and
   executing guest PM4 on the GPU would add a second PM4 decoder outside the typed-operation list
   that `GPU-2` (ADR 0011) makes the only input to execution. If such a stream is ever measured, it
   needs its own ADR reconciled with 0011.
6. **Every route is observable without a log**, as `IndirectDispatchBackendStats` is today:
   device-resolved, host-fallback and rejected counts per route, and the existing perf-alarm skip
   reasons keep their names.

No spec rule is added. This ADR is how prosper meets the existing `PERF-P1` for indirect work;
a rule may follow once the draw route exists and an instrument can count its CPU reads.

## Consequences

- `resolve_indirect_draw_arguments` stops being the only path; it remains as the fallback for a
  record that is CPU-produced and CPU-visible, where reading it is correct and free.
- The resource layer must answer "which buffer is authoritative for these guest bytes, now" for
  draw records, as it does for dispatch triplets. That is ADR 0010's canonical resource identity;
  this ADR depends on it rather than adding a second answer.
- A GPU-resolved draw count is invisible to the CPU, so draw-count censuses and the retained-draw
  selection (`retained_draw_selected`) must not assume a known count. Diagnostics that need the
  value read it back off the frame, explicitly, under a diagnostic switch.
- CPU-side sizing derived from a draw count needs another bound once the count is GPU-resolved.
  Index and vertex ranges uploaded or validated per draw, and the owned-wave index window
  (`owned_graphics_wave_draw.cpp:161-164` sizes it from `draw->index_count`), must take an upper
  bound from the record's own limits or the bound buffer's size, or keep that draw on the CPU path
  with a named reason.
- Validation moves from CPU `if`s to shader code, and needs Vulkan-execution tests: a guest record
  produced by a compute pass in the same submit, an out-of-range count zeroed, `firstInstance != 0`,
  and a zero-count no-op. Each must fail with the device route removed.
- Conditional rendering and DGC add optional-feature checks to device setup; their absence must be
  a named refusal, not a silent CPU read.

## Alternatives considered

- **CPU readback with pipelined latency** (read the argument one or more frames late, or wait only
  for the producer). It still reads a value the guest does not observe, so it violates `PERF-P1`;
  it either waits in-frame or renders with last frame's counts, which is wrong content for any
  culling or streaming pass whose output changes per frame. Rejected.
- **Keep refusing** (`indirect-dependencies`, `[agc] indirect draw skipped`). Honest, but it drops
  GPU-driven culling and particle passes wholesale; the Black Flag alarms are exactly that loss.
  Kept only as the last resort in item 5.
- **DGC for everything.** Simpler conceptually, but DGC support is narrower than core indirect and
  heavier per sequence; core commands cover the measured cases.

## Migration order

By measured skip reason, largest first:

1. Re-measure: run Black Flag and two guarded titles with a manifest, and record the
   `indirect-dependencies`, `indirect-arguments-unreadable`, `host_fallbacks` and
   `indirect draw skipped` counts per frame, so the order below is evidence, not guess.
2. Indirect dependencies on dispatches: barrier instead of skip (item 3). This step does not wait
   for ADR 0011: it records an interim explicit `SHADER_WRITE` -> `INDIRECT_COMMAND_READ`
   dependency on the argument range, the same shape 0011's barrier inference later absorbs.
3. Indirect draws: device route with validation pre-pass (items 1-2).
4. `DRAW_INDEX_INDIRECT_MULTI` with a count buffer.
5. Predication via conditional rendering (item 4).
6. DGC, only for a measured GPU-produced multi-draw or dispatch sequence that fits its tokens.

## Open questions

- Driver support for `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` on RADV and NVIDIA's Windows driver is
  stated from knowledge (both were reported to expose it after its 2024 release) and is
  **unverified** here; check `vulkaninfo` on both development hosts before relying on it.
- Whether any title writes a PM4 command stream with the GPU; none is known, and such a stream is
  refused (Decision 5) until its own ADR exists.
- Whether the Black Flag skips are producers prosper never recorded (no fix here) or producers in
  the same submit (fixed by item 3). Step 1 decides.
- How `firstInstance != 0` should behave: the current refusal predates any evidence either way.

## Approval

The project owner accepts or rejects this ADR. Acceptance unblocks the draw-side device route and
makes the CPU read of a GPU-produced indirect argument a review finding under `PERF-P1`.
