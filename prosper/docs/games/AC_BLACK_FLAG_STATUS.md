# Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced (`PPSA28183`) — status

Tracker: [#4131](https://github.com/mattias800/prosper/issues/4131). This document is the technical
record the tracker points at; the tracker holds the rung.

**Rung 0 at first measurement (historical). Since #4586 the title renders its health-warning screen and the
intro cinematic** (capture: `assets/screenshots/ac-black-flag-warning-fixed.webp`); tracker #4131 holds the
current rung. The paragraphs below describe the original stall (see also § Progress 2026-10-02 (later)). First measured 2026-10-02 on Windows 11 (MinGW build, NVIDIA RTX 4070
SUPER) at main `deff140b8d4a`, then again with the thread-handle fix of #4129 applied.

The guest boots in about 1.6 to 2.0 s and `prosper-app` opens its window, but no guest frame is
presented, so the window stays black. **A black window here is not a slow load.** On unmodified main
the guest's primary thread was already dead 1.6 s into the run while the app sat idle for over an
hour (see § Ruled out).

## Facts about the dump

- `titleId=PPSA28183`, `contentVersion=01.006.038`, `masterVersion=01.00`, `sdkVersion=0x1200000000000000`,
  `applicationDrmType=upgradable`. The AGC register-defaults line reports SDK version 9, which
  disagrees with that `sdkVersion`; not investigated.
- Content is `DataPS5_*.forge` archives, which points at Ubisoft's Anvil engine (inferred from the
  file names; no engine string was read from the binary).
- The dump carries third-party stand-ins for Sony libraries (a `fakelib/` folder with
  `libSceAgc`, `libSceAgcDriver`, `libSceAmpr`, `libScePlayGo` and `libScePsml`, an
  `ampr_emu.index`, and an `eboot.decoded.elf`). prosper's `module_path_policy` is the guard that
  rejects such locations; whether it fired on this dump was not checked in these runs. Disassembly
  for this document was taken from the SELF `eboot.bin` flattened with
  `tools/il2cpp/prx_to_elf.py`, not from the pre-decoded ELF.

## Reproduction route

The diagnostic route below uses a build with open PR #4129 applied;
`PROSPER_EXIT_ON_GUEST_END` is not available on unmodified main.

```powershell
$env:PROSPER_RENDER='1'; $env:PROSPER_GUEST_ARGS='-force-gfx-direct'
$env:PROSPER_BOOTPHASE='1'; $env:PROSPER_EXIT_ON_GUEST_END='1'
.\prosper\build-mingw-app\prosper-app.exe --dump "<DUMP_ROOT>\PPSA28183-app0"
```

- `PROSPER_BOOTPHASE=1` prints the seven boot phases; the last one names where a stalled boot is.
- `PROSPER_EXIT_ON_GUEST_END=1` (added with the dead-guest report) quits when the guest entry thread
  ends instead of idling on a black window. It currently exits 0 even after a crash.
- **Vulkan on this host.** The NVIDIA ICD was not registered in the Windows registry, so the first
  launch died with `Installed Vulkan doesn't implement the VK_KHR_surface extension` and
  `vulkaninfo` reported `Found no drivers!`. Setting `VK_DRIVER_FILES` to the driver's `nv-vk64.json`
  in the DriverStore makes both work. This is a host setup problem, not a prosper defect.
- There is no input route yet: nothing renders, so there is nothing to navigate.

**Best checked-in screenshot: none.**

## Progress 2026-10-02 (later): the guest now runs; every draw is dropped

With #4129, #4146 and #4166 on main plus the open PRs #4174 (APR completion filter -25), #4189
(fixed direct-memory remap on Windows) and #4194 (empty MultiDcb segments), and the opt-in init
deferral prototype (not for merge; branch `proto/defer-autolink-init` on the contributor fork), the
title no longer stalls or aborts. A 60 s run loads `libmemorywrapper_f.prx` and `libaegir_f.prx` from the
eboot, creates the engine threads, reaches AGC initialisation, registers three 1080p scanout
buffers and flips about 40 to 50 times with audio playing. The window is still black.

Why it is black (`PROSPER_DBG=1`, one 40 s run, NVIDIA host, 32-lane subgroups): only 15 draws are seen
and none is issued. Thirteen fragment programs are refused by the recompiler and two by the backend
(`subgroup-contract`, `unproved-vote`). Eighteen compute programs are refused too, so their outputs
are never written. Of those, eleven stop at an image instruction (`MIMG`) with
`mode=unresolved-operand`; one example reads `[mimg-unresolved] pc=38 op=0x00 srsrc=s20 srt_tag=NONE
key_res=null ud_alias=NONE written=1`, i.e. the T# in `s20..s27` was written by the shader itself and
no SRT-tag, fetch-pc or user-data-alias route resolves it. Others stop at `s_cselect_b64` with `vcc`
as destination (`pc=20`), an `SMEM` load, and one `s_branch` the structured emitter cannot place.
This is the same recompiler/resource-binding frontier recorded for other titles (`docs/gpu/RECOMPILER_REMAINING.md`,
`docs/gpu/RESOURCE_BINDING.md`); it is not specific to this title. Not yet established: whether the host's
32-lane subgroups (against the guest's wave64) are what blocks the two `subgroup-contract` fragment
draws, since the compute refusals print `host-subgroups=unavailable`. (That field never described the
host on a `…/recompile` refusal: it had no host fields to print. Since #4530 those lines print
`not-consulted`; only the two `subgroup-contract` lines carry the host range.)

## Progress 2026-10-06: the solid red frame in the first seconds is fixed (#4197)

Cause: a render-target cache entry served to a view that cannot be that target. Measured: draw 36 of the
first submit clears `0x4205990000` through a pixel shader that exports the constant `0x7bff7bff` (half
max, 65504) into a **2-byte R16_FLOAT** target. Draw 62 then samples the same address through a
descriptor that is **4-component 8-bit at 1920x1080**, i.e. a view needing twice the bytes the target
holds. prosper accepted the cached entry on extent alone, nearest-copied the half-max values and the
post pass (`0x407f7f9400`, whose colour is `exp2(gamma * log2(sample))` with gamma 1.0 at that point)
wrote them straight through as `(1,0,0,1)`. `rtt_sampled_texel_footprint_compatible` /
`live_rtt_serves_sampled_view` now refuse a cached target for a view that needs more bytes per texel
than the target stores, so the sample reads the guest backing instead. Windows `prosper-app`, NVIDIA,
default launch: grabs at 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 ms were `(255,0,0)` before and `(0,0,0)` after;
later frames settle at `(2,2,2)`. Regression: `LiveTargetFormat.CachedTargetServesAViewOnlyWhenExtentAndTexelFootprintFit`
and `RttScale.SampledViewNeedingMoreBytesThanTheCachedTargetIsAnAlias`.

**Inferred, not measured:** that the address was *reused* by a later RGBA8 writer. No writer of that
range between draws 36 and 62 was named (writer provenance or the guest GPU write journal answers it in one run), so
the refusal is `CONFIDENCE: MED`. Without such a writer, hardware would read the R16F clear bytes
reinterpreted, not "the guest backing", and the black after the fix may be the fallback's zeros rather than a
correct value; "not red" is the only verified property.

The cached side is judged by the GUEST target format (`RttSurf::guest_format`), not the renderer's host
storage, which folds every format outside a short list into RGBA8. A refusal logs `[rtt] footprint-alias
refusal` (first 32, then powers of two) so a cross-title false refusal is visible.

What this does **not** establish: what the frame should show at these moments (black is the expected
rung-1 reading, not a verified oracle), and the draws that should refresh the aliased range are still
dropped (below).

## Progress 2026-10-06: what is still refused at startup

Four compute programs are refused and a fragment draw is dropped in the first submits; none of them is
the red frame (next section). Reasons, from `PROSPER_DBG=1` and `shader_inspect`:

- `cs 0x407ed7a300` (2x2x2 groups): `image_sample_l` over a 3D 32x32x32 T#. The resource table skips
  the descriptors with `[t#] unsupported BASE_LEVEL N (last=N max_mip=5) for type=10`, so the MIMG has
  no resource (`need=sampled ... (2 res)`). The NSA address word printed beside it is not the blocker:
  `cvg()` already reads NSA addresses for sampling.
- `cs 0x407ee26700`: `s_cselect_b64 vcc, s[2:3], s[4:5]` with an incomplete source pair; it writes a
  256-byte buffer the indirect draws read, so those draws drop ("dependency latch").
- `cs 0x407ef88500` (30x17 groups): a full-screen luma/edge filter, a 4-iteration `s_branch` loop with
  four `s_mov_b64 exec, vcc` / `s_cbranch_execz` ifs inside it; EXEC is narrowed at the branch, so the
  counted-loop route's full-EXEC proof declines.
- `cs 0x407ed65200`: `s_cbranch_scc1` at pc 93, control flow the structurizer cannot place.
- a fragment draw at `0x407edfaf00` is refused by the 64-lane `unproved-vote` contract (host range 32..32).
  **Shape of the vote**, from the run log's `[wave64-unsupported]` line (`vote-source-word=870`,
  `vote-result-id=72`, `vote-predicate-id=71`, `predicate-def-op=169`): one `OpGroupNonUniformAny`
  whose predicate is an `OpSelect` (a `v_cmp` result masked by EXEC) and whose only consumer is the EXEC
  test guarding an `s_cbranch_execz` skip. That is ADR 0028 route 2's first candidate. Which of that
  certificate's conditions the skipped region meets is **not measured**: the draw's shader words are in no
  dump here (`refused_shaders_*` holds the four compute programs only), so see `## Ruled out`.
  **Does ADR 0028 step 1 admit the `0x407edfaf00` draw? Not yet (open).** Measured 2026-10-08 on the real
  pixel shader (Windows, `tools/screenshot` frontend, default launch with `PROSPER_RENDER=1`,
  `PROSPER_GUEST_ARGS=-force-gfx-direct`, `PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP_SUCCESS` with
  `PROSPER_SHADER_DUMP_PROGRAM=0x407edfaf00`; 83 dwords, 54 instructions). **Not admitted, for two
  separate reasons, both below the guest-level classifier's reach.** The vote is `v_cmpx_ge_f32` (EXEC)
  followed by `s_cbranch_execz` over pc 21-27: `s_load_dwordx4 s[0:3]`, `s_buffer_load_dword vcc_lo`,
  `v_mov_b32 v5, vcc_lo`. (1) Guest side: the region is scalar loads plus one VALU move, all with
  destinations dead at the merge, but `sgpr_dead_at_merge` did not model a non-cmpx VOPC with an explicit
  SGPR pair destination as redefining the pair (the merge's `v_cmp ... s[0:1]` writes), so s0-s3 read as
  live. With that kill modelled (opt-in parameter, used only by the classifier) the classifier reports the
  region clean. (2) SPIR-V side, still open: the body holds an `OpAccessChain` + `OpLoad` on the storage
  buffer (the `s_buffer_load`), and the neutral proof's closed domain admits no load, so the vote stays
  `unproved-vote`. The merge Phis are otherwise as needed: the masked vreg is `Select(P, load, 0)` against
  a skipped value `0`, and the `vcc_lo` Phi has no users. **Next step:** load authority in the neutral
  body, restricted to a robust2 word-buffer root with a bounded index (the existing `word_buffer_roots`
  conditions), whose result may reach only an identity-masked export or a dead value. Until that lands and
  the draw is re-run on a 32-lane host with its output compared, the draw is not admitted. The recompiler
  already linearizes an EXEC-masked VALU/VMEM region with no vote at all (`safe_execz_branches`), so a
  region that still carries a vote holds something that linearizer refuses; here it is the scalar loads
  and the VCC move.

## Progress 2026-10-07: the corruption starts at the autosave notice, and what is ruled out

Windows, RTX 4070 SUPER, `prosper-app --present-mode immediate`, direct frontend, J presses every 2 s from the
title (the title needs a Cross press after the logo). The window shows, in order: the Ubisoft logos, the
intro cinematic (correct, about 7 fps), the logo and the "historical fiction" disclaimer, the **autosave
notice** ("This game saves data automatically at certain points. Do not switch off the power when this icon
is displayed."), and from about 180 s a frame that is mostly black with solid white rectangles and a few
blue/red marks. Frame rate then falls to about 1 flip per second and the picture stops changing.

Measured with a one-off dump of the renderer's front-buffer image on every Nth GPU-published flip (the
image that is blitted to the window, read back from the persistent target at the flipped VA):

- Every flip from the first to the last is `outcome=published` from a renderer-owned persistent colour target
  (`1920x1080`, `gpu_valid=1`). The garbage is therefore **in the renderer's own target**, not a present-blit
  or CPU-fallback artefact. The target is written by a compute dispatch every few submits
  (`PROSPER_PROVENANCE_ADDR` on the middle scanout buffer: 321 `compute-buffer` writes of 8,847,360 bytes,
  one `color` write at submit 8).
- The white rectangles are solid, 104 px tall in a 1280-wide window, with scalloped lower edges; later flips
  show the same layout fading to a few red dotted lines and one white bar. It reads as a UI skeleton drawn
  without its textures, not as a mis-tiled frame.
- At the same stage the log shows 472 `[fragment-draw] refused reason=fragment-draw-producing-owner-unavailable`
  lines (distinct fragment identities refused by the original-fragment-packet route), 7 fragment programs
  refused by the 64-lane subgroup contract, 9 refused by the recompiler, 20 compute refusals
  (`partial-workgroup-barrier`, unresolved MIMG operands, cfg rejects) and `[draw-disposition] dropped=232`
  of 9,925 draws over a 255 s run.
- A fast-cleared one-component **R16F** pool surface (`1920x1080`, tile 27, six distinct addresses sampled by
  program `0x407f7d5500`) was reported `compressed sampled image kind=DCC ... is unsupported` and then sampled
  as its stale base bytes. `gfx10_dcc_fast_clear_rgba8` accepted only three- and four-component surfaces.
  It now also materializes one- and two-component clears (the clear colour fills the components that exist,
  the absent ones read (0,0,0,1)); the `is unsupported` lines are gone and six `[render] DCC fast-clear`
  lines appear instead. **This did not remove the garbage**: it is a correct fix for a real stale read, and
  not the cause of the white rectangles.

Ruled out by a switched A/B on the same route (`PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_RTT_DEST_MIRROR`,
`PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_RTT_DEST_CREATE`, `PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_RTT_MIRROR` all set, 250 s): the garbage appears
at the same time and in the same proportion (black 74-75%, white 4-5% of the window), so publishing compute
results into renderer images is not what produces it.

Instrument notes: F9 cannot capture this frame under GPU present (`F9 target was host-presented without known
producer lineage`: the scanout target's producer is a compute write that carries no lineage), and with
`PROSPER_APP_GPU_PRESENT=0` the window stays black ("no frames published yet") while F9 writes a correct
frame at the disclaimer stage, so the CPU path is not a stand-in for what the window shows. Several runs
ended with process exit code -1 and no final log line, at 41 to 180 s (no fault banner, no `shutting down`
line); the cause was not established and they are not evidence either way. Stop only your own PID when
scripting runs, since other sessions may be running `prosper-app` on the same machine.

## Current frontier

1. **Fixed by #4129 (open): the guest dereferenced a Windows thread handle.** At `eboot+0x161ed91`
   the guest does `mov rax,[handle]; mov ecx,[rax]` on the value `scePthreadCreate` wrote. prosper
   wrote the host `pthread_t`, which on MinGW is a small integer index, so the guest read address 3
   and the primary thread died (`ACCESS-VIOLATION addr=0x3 rax=0x3`). With the fix the guest passes
   that instruction and the `SystemLogger` thread runs. `CONFIDENCE: MED` on the handle layout (first
   dword is the thread id): inferred from this one disassembly, not checked against a PS5.
2. **Next: the observed fault is the title's abort path after a failed archive read.** The process
   exit code `0xC0000005` comes from a deliberate guest write to address 2. The cause of the failed
   archive read remains unresolved. Under gdb (Python
   script that lets prosper's expected `%fs:0` TLS-emulation faults and the init-function fault pass),
   the first other fault is at `eboot+0x5bcf9e4`, `mov DWORD PTR ds:0x2,0x0` (a write to address 2),
   reached straight after `call eboot+0x80` with `esi=0x100`. That is a `snprintf`-style call into a
   256-byte buffer, and the format string at `eboot+0xab1bd80` is
   `fseek error while reading the fat. Seek pos: %llu bigfile: %s`. So the title is reporting that an
   `fseek` on one of its `DataPS5_*.forge` "bigfile" archives failed while reading the archive's file
   allocation table, then crashes on purpose. The `%llu` argument was `0x524550534f525000`, which is
   not a plausible file offset and reads as the ASCII bytes of the string "PROSPER" shifted by one;
   whether that is prosper leaving an output uninitialised (for example an unimplemented `ftell` or
   `fgetpos`) is **not** established. Evidence: `gdb` run 2026-10-02 at main `deff140b8d4a` plus
   #4129; disassembly of the SELF `eboot.bin` flattened with `tools/il2cpp/prx_to_elf.py`. Still
   open: which libc or kernel call failed, with what offset and whence, and on which archive.
   Locating the final fault in guest code does not rule out an earlier HLE error or unfilled output
   as the cause of the failed seek; the stubs listed below remain untested.

Unexplained and not yet shown to matter:

- The init-function fault (`init fn 0x5d4000020 faulted ... addr=0x0 rip=0x5d4234ab0`, #4139) is
  **not benign and is now explained, but not fixed**. `0x5d4000000` is `libaegir_f.prx`; `0x5d4000020`
  is its module entry (a crt start that walks `DT_INIT_ARRAY`, so the rest of that array is skipped
  after the fault). The faulting code is a static constructor at image `+0x234a70` that calls the
  title's pooled allocator (`+0xb6f70`, which falls to `+0x1e90`). On a first allocation that
  allocator reserves a 1 GiB arena through the import `WLABcNu8BnU`, which resolves to
  `libmemorywrapper_f.prx` (`0x5d0000000`). That export is a thin dispatcher: when the module's callback
  table (`+0xc018`) is zero it returns 0, the allocator returns NULL, and the constructor stores through
  it (`mov %rax,(%rax)` with `rax = 0`). The table is only filled by `libmemorywrapper_f`'s own init
  export (`d1C59AHrOPI`, `+0xd0`), which no linked module imports, so the title has to call it itself.
  prosper links both root-level PRXs as boot-time dependencies and runs every init before the eboot
  starts, in ascending name order (`libaegir_f` before `libmemorywrapper_f`), so the guest has not yet
  had a chance. The eboot carries the strings `/app0/libmemorywrapper_f.prx` and `libaegir_f.prx`,
  which suggests the title loads both itself with `sceKernelLoadStartModule` (initialising the wrapper
  first) and that deferring auto-linked modules' init until that call would be the faithful fix. Not
  verified: no run got far enough to observe a `sceKernelLoadStartModule` call, because both an
  unmodified and an aegir-init-skipped run die later at `__stack_chk_fail` during `sceUltInitialize`.
  That change would alter init timing for every title that auto-links a module, so it needs a
  cross-title census before landing. Evidence: gdb and disassembly of the SELF modules flattened with
  `tools/il2cpp/prx_to_elf.py`, 2026-10-02, main `4a2ea88d` plus #4129 and #4137.
- The `__stack_chk_fail` that ended the "Loading Thread" right after `sceUltInitialize` is explained
  and fixed on main by #4146 (filed as #4138): `sceKernelAprSubmitCommandBufferAndGetResult`
  (`ASoW5WE-UPo`) takes `(cb, ring, result*, uint32_t* id)`, the title passes a 4-byte stack int
  for the id (`eboot+0x24511b0`) directly under its canary, and prosper stored an 8-byte token
  there, zeroing the canary's low dword. Evidence: the stack copy of the canary read
  `0x5245505300000000` against the expected `0x524550534F525000`.
- With that fix and the deferral prototype applied the process no longer dies: about 25 guest threads
  (`TaskThread00..11`, `IdleThread00..02`, `Loading Thread`, `SaveGameThread`) all sit in
  `sceKernelWaitCond`/timed waits and the guest main thread waits on a condition variable that a
  worker had already broadcast before it began waiting. `kqueue` and `kevent` (`libScePosix`)
  still return 0 through the unimplemented stub, so a descriptor of 0 comes back from `kqueue`;
  whether the stall is an engine file-completion path waiting on them is a hypothesis, not a result.
- Where the stall sits, from guest disassembly (eboot offsets): the title does load the memory
  wrapper itself. `eboot+0x3d136b0` calls `sceKernelLoadStartModule("/app0/libmemorywrapper_f.prx")`
  and then `sceKernelDlsym(..., "AE_MemoryWrapper_Init")`, which is the wrapper's init export
  (`d1C59AHrOPI`) that fills the dispatch table the aegir constructor needs. That function has no
  direct callers (only reachable through an indirect call) and is never reached in a run: no
  `sceKernelLoadStartModule` call is seen in 80 s. The guest main thread is parked in a scheduler
  loop (`eboot+0x21adff0`, called from `+0x21adf60`) waiting for a flag that a worker sets after
  starting (`+0x5deaa34`), and the twelve `TaskThread`s and three `IdleThread`s are idle. So the
  open question is what the engine's startup waits on before it reaches the wrapper load, not the
  wrapper itself. `kqueue`/`kevent` are called once each by the eboot (`+0x334ebba`, `+0x334ebd1`)
  to register one read filter on ident 0 and nothing waits on them, so they are unlikely to be
  the blocker; no implementation is in flight elsewhere (#4153 lists them out of scope).
- `scePthreadAttrGetstack` is unimplemented and returns 0 without filling its outputs. The
  `SystemLogger` thread called it right before the crash; that is a suspicion, not a result.
- Unimplemented calls returning 0, names from `ps5rs/data/nids.csv`: `kqueue`, `kevent`
  (`libScePosix`), `sceKernelGetOperationMode`, `sceNpAppLauncherInitialize`,
  `sceCoredumpRegisterCoredumpHandler`, `sceNpSessionSignalingInitialize`, `sceKeyboardInit`.
  Whether any is required to reach a frame is not known. Per the project's entitlement rule, answers
  must come from local inventory, never a blanket "owned".

### Where the compute CPU time goes (graceful-exit census, 2026-10-06, 42.7 s, Windows/NVIDIA)

`prosper-app` closed through its window (`CloseMainWindow`) prints the exit censuses that a `timeout` kill
loses. Totals: host copies 8,241 MiB (193 MiB/s): `storage-materialize` 2,147 MiB/390 calls,
`rtt-snapshot` 2,577 MiB/517 calls, `detile` 3,518 MiB/1,361 calls. The same census attributes the
renderer-owned bindings' CPU round trip to `cpu-only-authority` (2,080 MiB/263 calls, one 7.9 MiB frame-sized
image each): a compute result is published to the renderer as a CPU snapshot, so the next dispatch that
samples it re-uploads it.

The GPU-side mirror (no CPU copy) accepted 283 of about 1,800 compute results tested. The first failing
field for the rest: `format-no-seed-path` 780 (R8Unorm results; the renderer-image storage seed path exists
only for Rgba8, Rgba16F and R11G11B10), `format-unmapped` 611 (R10G10B10A2, which `storage_target_format`
does not map and which is published through `publish_unorm10_as_rgba8`), `prior-output-conflict` 48,
`mip-base-level` 30, `mip-tail` 25, `final-output-conflict` 24. Writebacks per submit are about 7: two
R10G10B10A2 (8.8 MB), one RGBA8 (8.8 MB), one R8 (8.3 MB), plus small ones. So the frame's CPU round trips
come from two result formats, not from many small leaks; removing them is a native-storage-image feature
for those formats (recompiler typed storage view, renderer seed path, mirror), not a cache tweak.

## Ruled out

- **"Write-watch can take over the per-frame compare of the constant ring on Windows."** Not available:
  on Windows `GuestWriteWatch::create` always reports unsupported (page-protection watches corrupt the
  guest SysV red zone, and direct memory is section-backed so `MEM_WRITE_WATCH` cannot see it), so every
  CPU-written guest source is validated by a full compare. Measured 2026-10-06 with the arena on: the
  guest rewrites 0.25-0.3 MiB of the ~59 MiB ring per frame, validation is `full` once per frame
  (journal for the other windows), and forcing promotion with `PROSPER_COMPUTE_WATCH_DEFER_MIN_KB=0`
  armed nothing (`watch=0` in the `PROSPER_WATCH_PROMOTE_CENSUS` totals). The remaining lever is the
  compare itself (~11 ms/frame under load), not the copy: block-granular sync (#4635) took the upload
  from ~49 MiB to ~0.3 MiB per frame.
- **"The black window is a slow load or a hang in a long boot."** Falsified: the primary guest thread
  ended with `ACCESS-VIOLATION addr=0x3 rip=eboot+0x161ed91` at about 1.6 s while the process stayed up
  for 72 minutes with 32 s of CPU and no further log lines; `BOOT_COMPLETE` is reached at 1.6 to 2.0 s.
  Evidence: `PROSPER_BOOTPHASE=1` run logs, 2026-10-02. Fix: #4129.
- **"The renderer or present path is at fault for the black window."** Not supported: the window opened
  and the renderer registered; no guest flip was ever issued because the guest was dead. The one
  `VK_KHR_surface` failure seen came from the host Vulkan ICD not being registered (§ Reproduction), not
  from prosper.
- **"The host crashes in an HLE stub after `sceKeyboardInit`."** Falsified for the first host-visible
  death: the exit code `0xC0000005` is the title's own abort path (write to address 2 after formatting
  `fseek error while reading the fat ...`), reached from `eboot+0x5bcf9e4`. This identifies the final
  faulting instruction; it does not rule out an earlier HLE error as the cause of the failed seek.
- **"The boot or link phase is what stalls."** Falsified by the phase log: all seven phases complete
  (`PROCESS_START` through `BOOT_COMPLETE`) in under 2.1 s.
- **"Bounding a read-only constant buffer by its shader's static extent removes the compute upload
  cost."** Not applicable to this title (2026-10-06, #4631): the bound never engages. The 43 MiB
  constant-buffer windows (`size=45088768`) reach `plan_storage_buffer_materialization` with
  `dynamic_access=1` (`required_bytes=4`), because the shader indexes them at a runtime offset, so SPIR-V
  reflection has no static bound to apply and both arms of the A/B ran the same path. The A/B (same
  binary, opt-out switch as control, 3 runs of 60 s per arm: 2.2 / 3.2 / 3.8 flips/s on against
  3.1 / 3.7 / 3.4 off) therefore only measured the noise floor and is **not** evidence against the
  idea; a bound derived another way (for example from the descriptor range) was not tried. The switch
  lived in a local branch that was never pushed and has been removed. The cost itself is real (below).
- **"The refused compute programs (`0x407ed7a300`, `0x407ee26700`, `0x407ed65200`, `0x407ef88500`) cause the
  solid red frame."** Falsified: the red pass `0x407f7f9400` does not read their outputs. It samples
  `0x4202a00000` and `0x4203270000` and a constant ring (dwords 17 and 18 read `1.0`, sane), and the red
  came from a cached 16-bit target served to an 8-bit view (see Progress 2026-10-06). The only
  relation is that the refused `0x407ef88500` *reads* the red pass's output. Evidence: `PROSPER_COMPUTE_BINDS`,
  `PROSPER_COMPUTE_RESOURCE_MAP`, SPIR-V of the pass, #4197.
- **"The G-buffer clear quad (fs `0x41b5de100`, CB_TARGET_MASK 0x3) paints the red."** Not supported:
  `PROSPER_SKIP_DRAW_PROGRAM=0x41b5de100` left all three probe pixels `(255,0,0)`.
- **"The `CB_COLOR_CONTROL.MODE=2` draw (fs `0x407ea1ff00`) is a mis-detected eliminate-fast-clear helper that
  should write no colour."** Not supported: its vertex program exports a UV parameter (AGC's helper does not)
  and its pixel shader is a deliberate clear to half-max. `PROSPER_CB_EFC_NO_COLOR=1` also removes the red,
  but by erasing a real clear, which only moves the error.
- **"Gating the last-pass present fallback until the first guest flip removes it"** Falsified earlier: the
  first guest flips already carry the red.
- **"The white 128x128 rectangles are the stale R16F DCC read."** Falsified 2026-10-07 (n=1 per arm, on a
  box where runs exited with code -1 at 41-180 s for a reason not established): with the one- and
  two-component fast-clear fix (#4699) the `is unsupported` warnings for those surfaces are replaced
  by `DCC fast-clear ... comps=1` lines (observed at head #4699 after the gate fix: 2 admissions on the 1920x1080 R16F surfaces, 0 `is unsupported`; the `75abf97ed` run showed six fast-clear lines before the correlation gate, and the gate as first written, at `48c379168`, left them `UNCORRELATED` and unsupported) and the black/white proportions of the corrupted frame are
  unchanged. The fix is still correct (the surfaces were sampled as stale bytes); it is not the cause.
- **"Publishing compute results into the renderer's images produces the garbage."** Falsified
  2026-10-07 (n=1 per arm, same caveat) with the three `PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_RTT_DEST_*`-style switches
  off: the same black/white proportions after 250 s. The corruption is already present in guest
  memory, i.e. in the guest's own compute-composite output, not added by the mirror.


## Performance, measured 2026-10-06 (PR head of #4586, Windows, RTX 4070 SUPER)

The title reaches the warning screen, then the intro cinematic, at about 2.7 to 3.8 flips per second
with the GPU about 10% busy. An F8 capture (5.2 s window, 14 flips) and
`PROSPER_COMPUTE_PHASE_TIMING` / `PROSPER_COMPUTE_BUFFER_TIMING` runs attribute it:

- Compute CPU time is about 270 ms of a ~370 ms frame; the GPU device time is about 39 ms. Of the
  compute CPU time, setup is 60%, writeback 20%, fence wait 17%.
- The dominant setup cost is the **read-only constant-buffer windows of 43 MiB** (`size=45088768`,
  `persistent=1`, `upload-skipped=0`). In one 40 s run with `PROSPER_COMPUTE_BUFFER_TIMING=1` (timing
  adds overhead; 69 submits, a #4635 build with `PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_BUFFER_ARENA=1`) they were acquired 449 times, about 6.5 per
  submit, with 185 distinct bases: 433 `cache=miss validation=pooled-full`, 15 `full`, 1 `journal`.
  Each acquisition cost 13.7 ms of `setup_ms` on average (compare 8.0 + copy 5.6, `compared-bytes` =
  45,088,768), i.e. about 89 ms per submit. Their bases
  advance a few hundred bytes per dispatch (`0x406260b900`, `c300`, `c700`, `d100`, `d500`, ...), so
  the compute buffer cache, keyed by window start, never hits, although the windows overlap almost
  entirely and the bytes at a given guest address do not change. That is the case ADR 0010 (canonical
  resource identity, `PERF-P9`) describes.
- Renderer side: `setup_resources` buffer copy 423 ms per 14 flips (768 MiB copied against 4,464 MiB
  avoided), and a GPU retile that is 78% of storage-copy device time.
- Alarms on this title: `host-copy-per-flip` (~24 MiB/flip), `gpu-sync-wait` (about 110% of the
  33 ms budget: every submit waits on its own fence, `PERF-P1` / `PERF-P6`, ADR 0009) and
  `surface-readback` (~9 ms per readback).

(All figures in this section are from a build with #4635 applied and its arena switched off
(`PROSPER_NO_COMPUTE_BUFFER_ARENA=1`), per the #4631 measurements; #4635 changes more than the arena, so
they are not figures for main, and the per-submit figures quoted in #4645 are from the same build with the arena on.)
