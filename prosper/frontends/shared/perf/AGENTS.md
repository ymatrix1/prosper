# `frontends/shared/perf` — bounded interactive performance capture

Owns F8's process-sample ring, bounded detailed renderer/compute records, completed capture writer,
and shared timing gates. The app schedules samples and capture completion; the live backends supply
measurements from actual work. Resource admission, cache ownership and synchronization belong to
those backends, not this recorder. Capture fields are additive; preserve existing presentation
counter semantics and represent unavailable fresh-render counts as unavailable rather than zero.

Keep default capture overhead bounded and separate frontend resource preparation from backend
setup. Timer leaves are nested in their enclosing buckets, not extra critical-path costs. Buffer
resident comparison bytes mean requested spans, not bytes actually read by an early-exiting compare;
reused/admitted/refreshed/declined/ineligible bytes are payload observations, not cache occupancy or
physical memory accounting. Refreshes copy changed contents only while the cache solely owns the
allocation; they are neither unchanged hits nor new admissions. Ineligible bytes count shareable
unique payloads of at least 4 KiB rejected by the whole-pass gate, including explicit controls, not
only shader-proof failures. `buffer_upload_bytes` counts all actual CPU upload copy spans, including
arena/pool, transient and resident copies and work whose later admission fails. Resident validation,
admission and refresh time is separate from ordinary arena/pool copy time; transient copies remain
within creation time. Live callbacks accumulate backend-call records
across ordered graphics spans before publishing one semantic-submit record; CPU serialization tests
here cannot substitute for a real backend-to-recorder integration guard in the live test family.

Direct-source write-watch reuse is a subset of total resident reuse. Watched bytes exclude exact
comparison spans; unknown or unsupported coverage retains comparison. The watch timer is a child
of resident time and must not be added to the buffer partition a second time. CPU snapshot
maintenance remains within resident time but is not another Vulkan upload-byte count.

Overlapping direct-view sharing reports actual union copy counts/bytes separately from resolved
unique descriptor slices/bytes. These are copy-span observations, not completed draws or physical
memory traffic. A planned union can include an unused member; keep bound-minus-upload bytes signed.
`res_buffer_range_plan_ms` includes metadata grouping and any needed shared negative-write proof.
It is nested in backend resource setup, outside the per-binding buffer timer and its copy leaf.

Compute image-transfer and retile timers are children of `gpu_storage_copy_ms`, not additional GPU
work. They use completion-point timestamps around the existing commands; dependency costs, overlap
with start markers and instrumentation effects prevent interpreting them as isolated execution
costs or removable time. Mirror copies and image transitions remain in the parent's signed residual.
Compare identically instrumented arms. Unsupported/failed queries contribute no timestamp sample.

**`unchanged_publication_census.hpp` / `unchanged_publication_hook.hpp`** answer one question during an F8 window:
how much of what the compute chain publishes to the renderer is byte-identical to the previous publication of the
same target? The census is a pure class (hash plus last-seen per target); the hook wraps the live renderer's
written-notifier and runs the census only while `detailed_timing_active()`, so there is no switch and no cost
outside a capture. The `[unchanged-census]` lines print at exit. Only publications carrying CPU pixels are
counted. The hash runs on the publishing thread inside the span F8 is timing, so compute timings taken in the
same window include it (reported as `hash_ms=`). History is per F8 window.
